Βοοι v111 DEATH OF POMPEIUS 241

‘ Nor do they dare a combat hand to hand;

‘ But as the winda may suffer, from alar

‘ They draw their bons at venture. Brave men love

‘ The sword which, wielded by a stalwart arm,

‘ Drives home the blow and makes the battle sure. 440
‘ Not such their neapons3 and the first assault

‘ Shall force the flying Mede with ooward hand

‘ And empty quiver from the field. His faith

‘ ln poisoned blades is placed ; but trusteat thou

‘ Those who without such aid reluse the war?

‘ For such allianoe wilt thou risk a death,

‘ With all the world between thee and thy home?

‘ Shall some barbarian earth or lowly grave

‘ Enelose thee perishing? E’en that were shame

‘ While Crassus seelrs a sepulchre in vain. 450
‘ Thy lot is happy ; death, unfearad by men,

‘ Is thy norst doom, Pompeius; but no death

‘ Awaits Cornelia—such a fate for her

‘ This king shall not reserve3 lor know not we

‘The hatelul secreta 01 barbarian love,

‘ Blind as of savage beasts? That palate knows

‘ No lans 01 kin: the noyal bed is foul

‘ With concubinas. The tale of that one crime

⁴ 01 old by OEdipus unwitting wrought

‘ Made nations shudder at the name 01 Thebes: 400
‘ How many an offspring of such foul embraoe

‘ Has held the Parthian throne? Where incestis right

‘ What shall be wickedness? This graeious dame

‘ Born 01 Metellus, noblest blood of Rome,

‘ Shall share the couch 01 the barbarian king

‘ With thousand others: yet in savage joy,

‘ Proud 01 her former husbands, he may grant

‘ Some larger share 01 favour; and the lates

‘ May seem to smile on Parthia3 for the spouse
