Βοοι 11 THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS 41

‘Sholl launeh itself on thee, sor who, when faint

‘And wounded, would not rush upon thy sword,

‘Toke thenoe his death, and make the murder thino ?
‘Dothou live on ὼγ peeoeful lifeaport ooo
‘As on their peths the storo unshoken roll.

‘The lower air that verges on the earth

‘Gives fleme and fury oo the levin bolt;

‘The deeps below the world engulph the winds
‘And traco of fleming fire. By Jove's deeree
‘Olympus reare his summit o'er the clouds:
‘In lowlier volleys slorms and winds oontend,

‘But peooe elemal reigns upon the heights.
‘What joy for Coesor, if ὼε tidings come Α
‘That such a citioen has joined the war? olo
‘Glad would he see thee e'en in Magnus* tento ς
‘For Cato's conduct shall opprove his own.
‘Pompeius with the Consul in his rsnks,
‘And half the Senote and the other chiefs,
‘Vexes my spirit; ond should Coto too
‘Bend to a moster's yoke, in all the world
‘The one man free is Caesor. But if thou
‘For freedom and thy country's lows alone
‘Be pleased fo raise the sword, nor Magnus then
‘Nor Coesar shall in Brutus find a foe. 320
‘Not till the fight is fought shall Brutus strike‚
‘'l'hen stn'ke ὼε victor?
Brutus thus ; but spake
cato fron] inmost breost these sacred words:
‘chief in all wickodness is civil war,
‘Yet virtue in the patho marked out by fate
‘Treeds on securely. Hoeven's will be the cn'rne
‘To hove made even Colo guilty. Who hos strength
‘To goze unowed upon a hoppling world?
‘When staro end sky fall heodlong‚ and when earth
‘Slips from her bose, who sits with folded hands? ³3⁰
