Urged on their ssight afar: the hand must grip
The sword end drive it to the foemsn's hesrt. ⁶80
But while Pompeius' mnis, shield wedged to shield,
Were ranged in dense emy, and scarce hsd spsee
To draw the blsde, came rushing st the charge
Full on the eenirsl eolumn Coesar's host,

Med for the battle. Man nor anns could siey

The foremost ranks might waver. These si his wohl,
No trumpet sounding, break upon the mnks ⁶10
0f Magnus' horsemen where they rode et large
Flanking the battle. They, unshsmed of seer
