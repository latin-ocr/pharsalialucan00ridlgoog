3001 m CATO

1 And venerated: to his native Rome

1 Ηο wrought much good. True saith in liberty

1 Long since with Marius and Sulla tled:

1 Now when Pompeius has been rett away , .

1 Its counterieit has perished. Now unshamed 100

1 Shall aeize the despoton Imperial power,

‘ Unshamed shall cringe the Senate. Happy he

‘ Who with disaster found his lateat breath

‘ And met the Pharian swoni prepared to slay.

1 Life might have been his lot, in despot rule,

ἷ 1 Prone at his kinsman's throne. Best gitt 01 all
ζ, 1 The knowledge how to die: next, death compelled.

1 11 011101 Fortune doth 1000110 101 me

1 An alien conqueror, may J uba be

1 As Ptolemaeus. So he take my head 100

1 My body grace his triumph, 11 he will?

More than had Rome resounded with his praise
Words such as these gave honour to the shade
01 that most noble dead.

Meanwhile the crowd
Weary 01 11011010, since Pompeius' fall,
Broke into discord, aa their ancient chief
Cilician called them to desert the camp.
They seize upon their ships and float the wave;
But Cato hailed them from the nearest shore;

‘ Untamed Cilician, is thy course now set 110

1 For Ooean theit agaim Pompeius gone,

1 Pirate art thou once more ?' Then all the air
Hummed with the mmmm 01 the throng; and one
Resolved on flight thus answered, 1 Pardon, chief,

‘ 'swas love 01 Magnus, not 0101111 war,

1 That led us to the light: his side was ours:

1 With him whom all the world preferred to peace,

1 0111 cause is perished. Let us seek our homes

1 Long since unseen, our children and our wives.
