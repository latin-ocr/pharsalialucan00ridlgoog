Boos Vl THE WITCH OF THESSALIA 169

Euenus ¹ purpled by the Centaur's blood

Wanders through Calydon ι in the Malian Gulf 430
Thy rapids fall, Spercheius: pure the weve

With which Amphrysos² irrigatus the meads

Where once Apollo served: Anaurus⁸ flows

Breathing no vapour forth ; no humid air

Ripples his surfaoe: and whatever stream,

Nameless iiself, to Oeean gives its waves

Through thee, Pendus :⁴ uhirled in eddies loams
Apidanus ς Enipeus lingere on

swift only when fresh streame his volume swell:

And thus Asopus lakes his ordered course, 440
Phoenix and Melas; but Eurotas keeps

His stream aloof from that with which he lions,
Peneus, gliding on his hopes though

Upon the channel. Fable says that, sprung

From derkest pools of Styx, with common floods

He seorns ho mingle, mindful of his source,
So that the gods above may feer him still.

¹ The god of this river fought with Hercules for the hand ol Deianira.
Alter Hercules had been married to Deianira, and when they were on a
jour-osy, they came ho the River Euenus. Here Nessus, a Oenmur, acted
as lersy-man, and Hercules bade him oarry Deianira across. ln doing so
he insulued her, and Hercules shoh him with an arrow.

¹ Admetus was King of Phene in Thessaly, aud suad ior Alcestis, the
daughter oi Pelias, who promised her to nimir he should oome in a ohariot
drawn by lions and boans. wisn the assistance ol Apollo, Admetus per·
formed this. Apollo, lor the slaughter ol the Cyclops, was condemned to
serve a morlai, aud socordingly he heuded the floeks of Admetus for nlns
years. The River Amphrysos is marked as flowing inho the Pagasaeau (iuli
at a short dismnoe below Pherae.

⁸ Auaurus was a small river passing iulo the Pagasaean uulf past
Ioloos. ln this river iason is said to have lost one of his slippers„

¹ The River Peneus flowed into the sea through the pass of Tempe, oloven
by Heruules between Olympus and Ossa (see line 406); aud carried with
ih Asopus, Phoenix, Melas, Enipeus, Apidanus, aud Titaresos (or Eurotas).
The Styx is generally plaoed in Arcadia, hut Lueau says thas Eurotas rises
from the Styglnu pools‚ aud that, mindful of this mysterious souroe, he
refuses to mingle hia streanm with that of Peneus, in order that the gods
may still fear to break au oalh sworn upon his wasers.
