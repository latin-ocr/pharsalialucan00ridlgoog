PHARSALIA Βοοι Χ

Nor fleme they oslled in aid ς’ but blind of plen
They wonder purposeless, in seperate hands
Around the timuit, nor et any' spot
With strength combined attempt to breseh the well.
'Ihe fetes forbed‚ omd Fortune from their hands
Held fast the peiece os a battlement. teo
Nor failed they to attach fmm ships of war
The regal dwelling, where its frontage bold
Mede stand epam the weters of the deep:
There, too, was Caesar's eil-protecting πως
For these st point of word, and those with ihe
He forces back, and though besieged he dares
To storm th' esseilants: smd as lay the ships
J oined rank to rank, bids drop upon their sides
Lemps drenehed with reeking ter. Nor slow the hie
To seize the hempen cebles end the decks ooo
Oozing with melting piteh; the oersman's bench
All in one moment, smd the topmost yemis
Buist into fleme: half merged the vessels lay
While swam the foemen, all in arms, the wave3
Nor fell the bleze upon the ships elone,
But seized with writhing tongues the neighbouring
homes‚¹
And fanned to sury by the Seuthem breeze
Tempestuous‚ it leaped from roof to roof3
Not otherwise than on its heavenly treck,
Unfed by matter, glides the boll of light, elo
By air alone aflame.
This pest mealled
Some of the forces to the city's aid
From the besieged halls. Nor Caesor gave
To sleep its sesson3 swister than all else

Ptolemies was destroyed. 400,ωο volomes ere stated to heve perished.
