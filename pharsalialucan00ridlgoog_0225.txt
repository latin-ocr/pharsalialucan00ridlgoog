PHARSALIA Βοοι v11

Upon his batque, which, driven by the seas,

Bears him an idle burden. Now the camp

Hums with impatienoe, and the breve man's heart loo
With beata tumultuous throbo against his breast3
And all the host had standing in their looks ¹

The paleness of the death that was to come.¹

On that day's light 'twea manifest that Rome

And all the future destiniea of men

Hung trembling; and by weightier dread posomed
They knew not danger. Who would fear for aelf
Should ocean riae and whelm the mountain lopo,
And aun and sky deooend upon the earth

In universal chaos? Every mind

la bent upon Pompeius, endon Rome.

They trust no sword until ita deadly point

Glows on the oharpening stone3 no lanoe will serve

Till straightened for the fray3 each bow is strung

Anew, and arrows chosen for their work

Fill all the quivers3 horsemen try the curb
And lit the bridle rein and whet the spur.

If toils divine with human may compare,

''l'was thus, when Phlegra bore the giant creor,2

ln Etna's furnaoe glowed the aword of Mars, 170

Neptunus' trident felt the fleme onoe more;

And great Apollo after Python alain

Sharpened his darts afreah: on Pallas* ahield

Weo spread anew the dread Medusa's hair3

And for the battle in Pallene's fields

The Cyclops forged new thunderbolts for Jove.
Yet Fortune failed not, as they eought the field,

In various presage of the ills to come;
