Βοοι lv CAESAR IN SPAIN 99

‘Where stood the renks erreyed, from whose right hond
‘The quivering lenoe was sped ε’ end while they boest,
Or chellenge deeds of prowess in the war,

Feith is renewed end trust Thus envious fate

Mede worse their doom‚ end all the crimes to be

The treeties mede, himself end all his oemp

Sold to the foe, he stirred his guard to work

An impious sleughter: the defenoeless foe

‘Of Rome forgetfuh to your seith forsworn !
‘And oould ye not with victory gained retrusi,
‘Restorers of her liberty, to Rome?
‘Lose then! but losing eall not Coeser lord.
‘While still your swords ere yours‚ with blood to shed

‘Will you like crevens to your master beer

‘Doomed eagles? Will you ask upon your kneee 25⁰
‘Thet Coesar deign to treet his slaves abke,

‘Nayl never shall our saiety be the price

‘Of bose betrsyol! Not ior boon oi life

‘Dregs us to slavery. Ne'er from depths of earth,

‘Fein to withdraw her werith, should toiling men

‘Ne'er should the war-horse desh into the frey

‘Nor lleet with turret bulwerks bresst the mein, reo

¹ ‘Peteuds esti'-is it fit that you should beg for the lives of your
