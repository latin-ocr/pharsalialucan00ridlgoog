PHARSALIA 1³00: v111

A Roman soldier, while thy blade yet reeks

From Megnus' sleughter, play the second part
To this bose veriet of the Pharian king?
Nor beer thyself the bleeding trophy home?
'Ihen‚ that the impious boy (ahl shameful fote) 79⁰
Might know the features oi the hero slein,
Seized by the looks, the drend of kings, which woved
Upon his stote1y front, on Pharien pike
The head was listed; while almost the life
Gave to the tongue its ecoents‚ end the eyes
W ere yet soeroe glnzed: thot heed et whose command
W ns peace or wer, that tongue whose eloquent tonos
Would move assemblies, end thet noble brow
On which were showered the rewerds oi Rome.
Nor to the tyrant did the sight suffice eoo
To prove the murder done. Τὴε perishing flesh,
The tissues‚ and the brein he bids remove
By art nefarious: the shrivelled skin
Drews tight upon the bone; and poisonous juice
Gives to the fece its lineaments in death.
Lnst of thy rece, thou bose degenerate boy,
About to perish¹ soon, end yield the throne
To thine incestuous sister ς while the Prince
From Macedon here in consecrated vnult
Now rests, and ashes oi the kings ere closed ⁸10
In mighty pyramide, and lofty tombs
Of thine unworthy fathers merl( the graves ;

Shell Magnus’ body hither ond thither borne
Be hunred, heodiesS, by the ocean wnve?

Τοο much it troubled thee to guard the corse
Unmutilated, for his kinsman’s eye

To witness! Such the fote which Fortune kept

' He wne drowned in attempting to escape in the battle on the Nile in
the [ollowing autumn.
