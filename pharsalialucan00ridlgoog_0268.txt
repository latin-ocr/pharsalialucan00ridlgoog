Boot VIII DEATH OF POMPEIUS 239

But murmuns rose,
And Magnus speaking knew his words condemned.
Then Lentirlus¹ answered, with indignant soul,
Foremost to ronse their valour‚ thus in words
Worthy a Consul: ‘Have Thessaliam woes
‘ Broken thy spirit so? One day's defeat
1 Condemned the world to ruin? la the oause
1 Lost in one battle and beyond recall?
‘ Find we no cure for wounds? Does Fortune drive oso
‘ Thea Magnus, to the Parthians' feet alone ?
1 And dost thou, fugitive, spurn the lando and skies
1 Known heretofore‚ and seek for other poles
1 And constellatione, and Chaldaean·gods‚
‘ And rites barbarian, servant oi the realm
‘ Of Parthia? But why then took we arms
‘ For love of liberty? If thou canst slave
1 Thou hast deceived the world! Shall Parthia see
1 Thoe at whose neme, ruler of mighty Rome,
1 She trembled‚ at whose leet she captive saw ³9⁰
‘ Hyrcanian kings and Indian princes kneel‚
‘ Now humbly suppliant, victim of the fates;
1 And at thy prayer her puny strength extol
1 ln med contentiori with the Western world?
1 Nor think, Pompeius, thou shalt pleed thy cause
‘ ln that proud tongne unknown to Parthian ears
‘ Of which thy ieme is worthy3 sobs end teers
‘ He shall demand oi thee. And has our shame
1 Brought us to this, that some barbarian foe
‘ Shall venge Hesperia's wrongs ere Rome her own? loo
‘ Thou wert our leader for the civil war:

‘ Mid Scythia's peoples dost thou bruit abroad
