Boos lv WAR IN THE ADRIATIC 105

Whose oonsuls 000 forgotten, served in oups
With gold oud jewels wrought, restores the spark,
The falling spark, of life; but water pure
And simplest fruito of earth. The flood, the field 400
Suffice for nature. Ah! the weory lot
Of those who war! But these, their srmour laid
Low st the victor's feet, with lightened hoesst,
Soeure themselves, no longer dealing death,
Beset by core no more, seek out their homes.
What prioeless gift in pesoe hod they secumd!
How grieved it now their souls to hove poised the dart
With unu outstretehed3 to have felt their raving thirst;
And prayed the gods for victory in vuin !
Nsy, hurd they think the victor's lot, for whom 440
A thousand rislss sod battles still remain3
If fortune never is to leave his side,
How often must he triumph! ond how oft
Pour out his blood where'er great Cesar lesds!
Happy, thn'oe happy, he who, when the world
Is nodding to its suin, knows the spot
Where he himself shall, though in min, lie!
No trumpet coll shall break his sleep again :
But in his humble home, with faithful spouse
And sons unlettered, Fortune leaves him free 400
From rago of porty; for if life he owes
To Coesor, Magnus sometime was his loni.
Thus happy they olone live on spari,
Nor hope nor dread the event of civil war.
Not thus did Fortune upon cesar smile
In 011 the ports of earth ; ¹ hut 'goinst his arms
Dared somewhst, where Solono's lengthy waste
Is lsved hy Hadria, ond ludar worm
