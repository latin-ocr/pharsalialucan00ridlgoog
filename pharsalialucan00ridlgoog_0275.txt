‘ He asks for help from ours not yet betrayed.
⁴ But none than Egypt with this chief from Rome

‘ Has juster quaneh who has sought with arms ·
‘To stain our Pharos, distant from the strife

⁴ And peaceful ever, and to make our realm

‘ Suspeeted by his victor. Why alone oso
‘ Should this our country please thee in thy fall?

‘ Why bring'st thou bere the burden of thy fatas,

‘ We have olfenoe which by the sword alone

‘ Can find its condonation, in tbat we

‘ To stir Pharsalia's ashes and to eall olo
‘ War to thy kingdom? Ere the light was fought

‘ We joined not either army—shall we now

‘ Make Magnus friend whom all the world deserte?
‘And fling a challenge to the oonquering chief

‘ And all his proud suooesses? Fair is help

‘ Lent in disaster, yet reserved for those

‘ Whom fortune favours. Faith her friends selecta
‘Not from the wretnhed? Then they all deoree
