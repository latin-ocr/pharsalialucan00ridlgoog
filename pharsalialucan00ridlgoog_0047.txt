‘ He draws. As tigers in Hyrcanium woodo
‘ Wundering‚ or in the caves that saw their birth,
‘ Onoe having lapped the blood of slaughlered line,

‘ Ol cruel Sulla, nursed in civil war,
‘ Ouutrips his merten and the tongue which licled
6 That reeking weupou ever thirsis for more.
‘ Smin onoe the lips with blood, no other meal 38⁰
‘They shall enjoy. And shall there be no end

6 Nuy, this one lesson, ere it be too lete,
6 Leern oi thy gentle Sulla-to metire !

‘ Where shall the weery soldier lind his rest?
‘ what college homes their joys‚ what lields their fruit
6 Shell m our veterane yield? Will Magnus my

‘ As through those glorious years. Deny our rights!
6 He that denies them makes our quarrel just.
6 Nuy ! use the strength that we have made our own. 400
6 Νο booty seek we, nor imperial power.
‘ This would-be ruler of subservient Rome
6 We force to quit hie grasp; and Hoeven shall ornile
‘ On those who eeelr to drag the tyreut down?
Thus Caeser spoke3 but doubtful murmure ran
Throughout the crowd3 their household gods und homes
