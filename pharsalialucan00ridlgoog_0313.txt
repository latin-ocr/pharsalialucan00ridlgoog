PHARSALIA

6 Ι)ο injury? Do Fortune's threets eveil

6 Outweighed by virtue? Doth it not suffice

‘To aim et deeds of bravery? Cen fame

6 Grow by achievement? Ney! No Hammon's voice

6 Shull trech us this more surely then we know.

6 Bound ore we to the godo; no voice we need ς eto
6 They live in all our ecte, although the shrine

‘ Be silent: at our birth end once for all

6 What may be known the author of our being

6 In virtuous deeds; in all that thou coust seo,

‘ Seek we our deities? Let those who doubt ooo

‘ Go esk the oracles. No mystic words,

‘ Make sure my heurt, but surely coming Deuth.

‘ Coweni alike end breve, we all must die.

‘ Thus harh Jove spoken z seek to know no more.'
Thus Cato spoke, end faithful to his creed

He purted from the temple of the god
And left the orecle of Hammon dumh.

Beuring his jocelinus one of thern
He strode efoot before the penting troops: oeo
No bending neck, no litter bore his form.
He bade them not, but showed them how to toil.
Spore in his sleep, the lest to sip the spring,⁴
When et some rivulet to quenoh their thirst
Τὴε eoger renks presoed onwnrd, he alone

‘Whose dwelling is the light of notting runo
And the round ocean eud the living air
And the blue sky end in the mind of men!
