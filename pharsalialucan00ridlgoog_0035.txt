PHARSALIA Booxsl

And all the distent Enst, end those who know

(If any such there be) the birth oi Nile,

Hed felt our yoke. Then, then, with all the world
Beneeth thee, Rome, if ior nefnrious wer

Such be thy passion, turn upon thyself:

Not yet was wanting sor thy swerd n foe.

Thet cnrmbied houses end half-ruined homes
Now mark our citiee; that the ancient streets
Sceroe henr the footfell oi the passer-by 3 no
That mighty fragments lie beside the wells ;

That henrths ere desolate ; thet fer end wide

Fields thick with bramble end untilled ior years

Demnnd the labours of the hind in vein:

Ali this nor Pyrrhus caused, nor Punic chief,

Nor swoni thrust deep. ''I'wns civil strife nlone

Thnt dealt the wound end left the death behind.
¹ Yet if the intes could find no other wey

For Nero's coming, nor the gods with ense
Gnin thrones in heeven3 end if the 'Ihunderer to

Preveiled not till the ginnts' wer wns done,

We plain no more, ye gods! ior such n boon
Ali wickedness be welcome end aii crime ς
