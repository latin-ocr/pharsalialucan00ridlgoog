PHARSALIA Boot vu

Gaul stood srmyed against her ancient foe.
let all the notions be the victor's prize, 270
None grace in future a triumpbal ως
This fight demands the sleughter of a world.
Caesar thet day to send his troops for spoil
Hsd lest his tent, when on the further bill
Behold t his foe descending to the plain.
The moment osked for by a thousand prayers
Is come, which puts bis fortune on the risk
Of imminent wer, to win or lose it all.
For buming with desire of kingly power

This civil war compelled: ecch instent lost
Robbed from his due! But when at length he knew
The lest great conflict come, the light supreme,
Whose prize the leodership of oll the world:
And felt the ruin nodding to its fell :
Swistest to strike‚ yet ior a little space
His rege ior battle failed3 the spirit bold
To pledge itself the issue, wavered now :
For Magnus' fortunes gave no room for hope,
Though Caeser's none for sear. Deep in his soul ceo
Such doubt was hidden‚ es to ronse the throng
He spele oi victory: ‘Ye men of Rome
‘ Who made my fortunm, host that won the world!

⁶ No more entreet the gods: with sword in bend
⁶ Seize on our fates3 end Cesar in your deeds
‘ This day is great or little. This the doy
‘ For which I hold since Rubicon was possed
‘ Your promise given: for this we llew to arms :¹
‘ For this delen-ed the triumphs which we που, ³⁰⁰
‘ And which the loe forbed: this gives you beck
