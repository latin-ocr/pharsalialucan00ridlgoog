Boo! vn THE BAmE 209

In ronch ol mole, lheir brothers and their sires
With fmnt opposing; yet lo yield their ground

1t ploesed them not. But all the host was dumb
With horton oold upon each loving beart,
Aweastmck, the life-blood pressed3 ond all men held

And wayward Fortune upon whom she wills
Malles fall the guill. Yel, for the hatoed bred
