Boos 111 MASSILIA

Struck once, and ended error: he that lived,
Conse of fresh anguish to their sorrowing souls,
Called ever to the weeping parents beel(
The image ol the lost: who, os the oars
Grecian and Roman mixed their teeth oblique,
Grnsped with his dexter hand the Roman ship;
When fell e blow that shore his arm away. oso
So died, upon the side it held, the hand,
Nor loosed its grasp in death. Yet wilh the wound
His noble cour-age rose, and maimed he dnred
Renew the fray, ond stretohed across the seo
To grasp the lost—in vain! another blow
Lopped arm andband slike. Nor shield nor sword
Heneel'orth are his. Yet even now he seelrs
No sheltering hold, but with his chesi advaneed
Before his brother mnred, he claime the light,
And holding in his breost the daris which else ooo
Hod slain his comi-edes, pieroed with countless spears,
He falls in death well eomed3 yet ere his end
Colleots his parting life, and sll his strength
Strains to the utmost and with falling limbs
Ieaps on the foemon's decl ς by weight alone
Injurious; ior streaming down with gore
And piled on high with corpses, while her sides
Sounded to ceoseless blows, the lated ship
Let in the greedy brine until her ways
Were level with the wetere-then she plunged too
ln whirling eddius downwmds-—and the main
hirst por-ted, then closed in upon its prey.

Full many wondrous deaths, m‘th lates diverse,
Upon the sea in tlrat day's light besell.
Caught by a gmpplinghook thot missod the side,
Hsd Lycidas been whelmed in middle deep;
But by his leet his comrsdes dmgged him boel,
