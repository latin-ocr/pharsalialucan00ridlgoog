Which thus broke forth in words: ‘Vain is the hope
‘Ye rest upon my march: speed though I may
‘Towanis my western goul, time still remains
‘To blot Massilia out. Rejoice‚ my troops!
‘Unsought the war ye longed sor meets you now:
‘The fates concede it. As the tempests lose
‘Their strength by sturdy foreste unopposed‚

‘And as the fire that finds no fuel dia,
‘Even so to find no foe is Coesar's ill.
‘When those who may be conquered will not light, 420
‘That is defeat. Degenerate, disarmed
‘Their gates admit me Ξ Not content, forsooth,
‘With shutting Caesar out they shut him in !
‘They shun the taint of war! Such prayer for peace
, ‘Brings with it chastisement. In Caesara age
‘Learn that not peace, but war within his ranks
‘Alone can make you saie?
He turns his march
Upon the scarleas city, and beholds
Fast bar-red the gata-ways, while in arms the youths
Stand on the battlements. Harri by the walls 430
A hillock rose, upon the further side
Expanding in a plain of gentle slope,
Fit (as he deemed it) sor a camp with ditch
And mound encircling. To a loity height
The nearest portion of the city rose,
While intervening valleys lay between.
These summits with a mighty trench to bind
The chief resolves, gigantic though the mil.
But first, from furthest boundaries of his mnrp,
Enclosing streams and meadows, to the sea 440
Το draw a rampart, upon either hand
Heaved up with earthy sod; with loity towers
Crowned3 and to shut Massilia from the land.
