soon x CAESAR IN EGYPT 313

No hunger urging. Frequent birds and bessis,

Egypt's high gods, they placed upon the board:

In crystal goblets water of the Nile

They hunded, and in massive eups of price

Was poured the wine; no juioe of Mareot grape‚¹ roo
But noble vintage of Falernian glnwth

Which seasons few in Meriie's famous vato

Had mellowed es with age. Upon their brows
Chaplets were placed of roses ever young

With glistening nard entwined; and in their looks
Was cinnamon infused‚ not yet in air

Its hegrence perished‚ nor in foreign climee;

And rich amomum from the neighbouring fieids

Thus Coeser learned the booty of a world

To lavish, and his breast was shamed of war eoo
Waged with his son-in·law‚ from whose defeat

His spoils were meagre, and he longed to find

A oense of battle with the Pharian realm.

When of the bouquet and of wine and feast
They wearied end their pleesure found an end,
cem drew out in oolloquy the night
Thus with Achoreus‚ on the highest couch
With linen ephod as a priest begirt:

‘ O thou devoted to all sacred rites,

‘ Lowed by the gods, as proves thy length of days, 21⁰
‘ Tell, if thou wilt, whence sprang the Pharian race;

‘ How lie their lande, the manners of their tribes,

‘ 'lhe form and worship of their deitiee.

⁶ Expound the sculpturea on your ancient lanes:

‘ Reveal your gods ifwilling to be known ι

‘ If to th' Athenian sege your fathers taught

‘ Their mysteries, who worthier than 1 '

¹ Yet the Mareot grape was greatly celebrated. (See Professor Rowlin·
son's note to Herodotus, ii.. 18.)
