5001 vn THE BA'ITLE ' 219

Though worn by battle, weoried with the iray:
‘ Soldieru,' he said, ‘the victory is ours,
4 Full and triumphant: there doth lie the prize
4 Which you bareumi, not Coeeur3 ot your feet
4 Behold the booty oi the hostile camp.
4 Snotohed from Hesperien notioris ruddy gold,
4 And all the richer oi the Orient world, sto
4 Are piled within the rents. The wealth os kings
4 Andos Pompeius here uwoits its louis.
4 Haste, soldim, ond outstrip the flying foe;
4 E'en now the uunquished of Pharsalio's field
4 Anticipote your spoils? No more he said,
But drove them, blind with henzy for the gold,
'l'o opimi the bodies of their fallen sires,
And tromple chiesa iu daehing on their prey.
What rampart had restroiued them us they rushed
To ouize the prize for wickedneoo aud war 880
And leam the prioe of guilt? And though they found
Iu ponderous messes heaped lor need of war
The trophies of a world, yet were their minds
Unsatisfied, that osked for oll. Whote'er
Iberian mineo or Tagus bring to doy,
(lr Arimaspians from golden sunds
May guther, hod they seized; still they had thought
Their guilt too cheoply sold. When pledged to theru
Wus the Tarpeiam took, lor victory won,
And ull the spoils of Rome, by Cresur's word, ooo
Shall cumps suffice them? Then plebeian limbs
On senators* turf took rest, on kingly oouch
The soldier wretch; und there the murderer loy
Where yesternight his brother or his sire.
In maddened dreams the fury os the light
Still urged, und in their sleep the guilty hund
Still urought its ‹leeds os blood, und resuess gripped
