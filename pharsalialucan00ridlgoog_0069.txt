PHARSALIA suoru

‘ Which Sulla mede, end plsee his loved remeius

4 On the forbidden pyre. The head 1 found,

4 But not the butcheoed corse.

' Why now renew

‘ The tale of Catulus's shsde sppeused? 200
4 And those dread tortures which the living frume

4 0f Μειιὶιιε1 suffered nt the tomb of him

‘ Who hsply wished them not ἓ Piereed, mengled, torn-
‘ Nor speech nor grasp was left: his every limb

‘ Meimed‚ hscked end riven ; yet the intel blow

‘The murdenens with sevege purpose spered

4 'Twene soeroe believed thet one poor mortsl hume

4 Such egonies oould beurere death should come.

4 Thus crushed beneeth some ruin lie the desd3

‘ Thus shspeless from the deep ore borne the drowned. 210
4 Why spoil delight by mutilating thus,

‘ The heed of Marius? To plesse Sulls's heert

‘Thst mangled vissge must be known to ell.

4 Fortune‚ high goddess of Praeneste's fene,

4 st ell her townsmen hurried to their deeths

4 In one fell instent All the hope oi Rome,

‘ The flower of lotium, steined with blood the field

4 Where onee the pesoefirl tribes their votes declmed.

‘ Femine end sword, the raging sky end ses,

4 And Eerth upheoved, hnve leid such numbers low : 220
4 But ne'er one men's revenge. Between the slein

4 And living victims there wns speoe no more,

‘ Denth thus let slip, to deel the intel blow.

4 Herdly when struck they fell ; the severed hesd

‘ Sesuoe toppled from the shoulders; but the slsin

‘ Blent in e weighty pile of messuere
‘ Pressed out the life end helped the murderer's urm.
4 Secure from stein upon his losty throne,

¹ The brother oi t-he Consul.
