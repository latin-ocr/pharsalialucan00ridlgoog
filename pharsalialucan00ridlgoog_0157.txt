Contains the deity, ita shattemd frame

Shakes the rrail breeth that with the god reoeivee,
Aa prine or punishment, untimely death.

‘Of Phoebus; or the ancient Sibyl's books

‘Dioclosed enough of sate, end thus the gods roo
‘Decreed to close the oracle; or else

‘Since wicked stepo are banished from the fane,

‘ln this our impious age the god finds none

‘Whom he may answer.' But the maiden's guile

Was known, for though she would deny the gods
