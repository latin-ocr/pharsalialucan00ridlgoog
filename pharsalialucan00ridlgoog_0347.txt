PHARSALIA Boos x

‘ Warm at their feet. Sesostris ¹ westward far eso
‘ Reanhed to the ends of earth ς and necis of kings

‘ Bent 'neoth his chariot yolre: but of the springs

‘ Which fill your rivers, Rhone and Po, he dranlr,

‘ Not of the lount of Nile. Cambyses king

‘ ln madman quest led forth his host to where

⁶ The long-lived raees dwell: then famine struck,

‘ Ate of his dead' and, Nile unknown, returned.

‘ No lying rumour of thy hidden source

‘ Has e'er made mention ; wheresoe'er thou art

‘ Yet art thou sought, nor yet has nation claimed aso
‘ In pride of place thy river as its own.
‘Yetshallltelhsofarashasthegod

‘ Who veils thy fountain, given me to know,

‘ Thy progress. Daring to upraise thy banks

‘ 'Gainst fiery Caneer's heat, thou tak'st thy rise

‘ Beneath the zenith : straight towards the north

⁶ And mid Bootes flowing 3 to the couch

‘ Bending‚ or to the risings of the sun

‘ ln sinuous bends altemate3 just alilre

‘ To Araby's peoples and to Libyan sands. ³50
‘ By Seres³ first beheld, yet know they not

‘Whenoe art thou oome; and with no native stream

‘ Strik'st thou the Ethiop fields. Nor knows the world

‘ To whom it owes thee. Nature ne'er revealed

‘ Thy secret origin, removed afar.
‘ Nor did she wish thee to be seen of men
