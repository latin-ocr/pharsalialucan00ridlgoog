PHARSALIA 1³00: 111

Too srrmly bite the sauds, to wreuch it free. ἣ

Οῆ ἱιι his fatal grasp he seized a l'oe

Nor loosed his grip until the life was gone.

Such was his frequent deed; but this his i'ate:

For rising, victor (as he thought), to air,

Full on a keel he struck and found his death.

Some, dronning, seiaed a hostile oar and checked
The flying vessel; not to die in vain,

Their single oare; some ou their vessel's side rso
Hanging, in death, with wounded frama essayed

To oheck the charging prow.

Tyrrhenus high

Upon the bulwarks of his ship was struck

By lenden bolt from Balearic sliug

Of Lygdamus; straight through his temples passed
The fated missile3 and in streams of blood

Forced from their seats his trembling eyeballa fell.
l’lunged in a darkness as of night, he thought

That life had left him r yet ere long he knew

'lhe living vigour of his limbs; and cried, rao
‘Place me, Ο friends, as some machine of war

⁴ Straight facing towmds the foe; then shall my darts
‘Strike as of old; and thou, Tyrrhenus, spend
‘Thy latest breath, still leit, upon the light :
⁶ So shalt thou play, not wholly dead, the part
‘'lhat lits a soldier, and the spear that strikes·
‘Thy frama, shall miss the living? Thus he snake,
And hurled his javelin‚ blind, but not in vaiu3

For Argus, generous youth os noble blood,

Below the middle waist received the spear roo
And falling dmve it home. His agad sire

From l'urthest portion of the conquered ship
Beheld; than whom in pride of munhood noue

More braye iu battle: uow uo more he fought,
