E'en now though trembling at the sictor's swoud,
Though oruel Caesar herald thy defeat,
Yet shall they grieve, while et the Thrmderer's throne
They offer incense aud the laurel wreath. oo
Ah, wretched fate! In silenoe must they groan;
Nor in that theatre which heard thy praise

'lhe stars had lled before the growing morn,
When eager voioes (as the fetes drew on
The world to ruin) round Pourpeius' tent

And peoples, eager for their distant homes,
Already murmured at the lengthy war.
Thus has it pleased the gods, when evoe impende
On guilty rnen, to make them seem its cause.
We court disaster, orave the fatal sword.

Trembled and lled, arose, to Magnus' ear
Bearing the voioe of all. To him was war
Grown hateful, and he longed onoe more to hear
The Senate's plaudits; and with eloquent lips
He lent persuasion to the weaker oause.
‘ Portare, Pompeius, for her git'ts to thee
‘ Asks this one boon, that thou shouldst use her now.
‘ Here ut thy feet thy leading captains lie; ao
