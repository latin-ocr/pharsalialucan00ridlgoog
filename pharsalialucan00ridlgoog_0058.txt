ΒοοιΙ THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON 27

‘ Esther: he said, ‘the world and countless orbs

‘ Throughout the ages wander at their will ;

‘ Or, if the futes control them, ruin huge

⁴ Hangs o'er this city ond o'er ull mankind.

‘ Sholl Earth yawn open und engulph the towns? ly ,-
‘ Sholl seomhing heat usurp the temperate air

‘And fields refuse their timely huit? The struams
‘Flow mixed with poison? In what plague, ye gods,
‘ln what destruction shall ye wrealr your ire? 720
‘Whate'er the truth, the days in which we live

‘Shsll find a doom for many. Hud the stur

‘Ol' baleful Saturn, frigid in the height,

‘Kindled his lurid lires, the sky hod poured

‘ Its tonents forth es in Deumlion's time,

‘And whelmed the world in waters. Oris thou,
‘Phoebus beside the Nemeen lion fieres

‘ Wert driving now thy chariot, flames should seire

‘The universe and set the air eblone.

‘These ane ut peece3 but, Mars, why ert thou bent 73⁰
‘ On kindling thus the Scorpion, his tail

‘Portending evil end his claws ullame?

‘Deep sunl< is kindly Jupiter, and dull

‘Sweet Venus' stur, and rapid Mercury

‘Stuys on his course: Mars only holds the sky.

‘Why does Orion's swonl too brightly shine?

‘Why planeto leave their puths and through the void
‘Thus journey on obscure? Tis war that comes,
‘Fierce rubid war: the swonl shall bear the rule
‘Confounding justice ς hatesul crime usurp 74⁰
‘The nume of virtue ; and the huvoc spread

‘Through many a year. But why entreat the gods?
‘The end Rome longs for und the final peooe

‘Comes with a despot. Draw thou out thy chain

‘Of lengthening slaughter, und (for such thy fote)
‘Male good thy liberty through civil war?
