The chains that held them ; without hope he fighn,
Unoertain where to avoid or frout the foe.
Caught in the strait they strove as brave men should
Against opposing bosts; nor long the light, ooo

Thus spake in tonas oommauding: ‘Free no more,
‘Save for this little night, consult ye now
‘In this last moment, soldiers, how to saue
‘ Your final fortunas. No man’s life is short
‘Who oau take thought lor death, noris your fame
‘Less than a conqueror's, if with braaat advanoed
‘ Ye meet your destined doom. None know how long oso
‘'Ihe life that waits them. Summon your own fate,
‘And equal is your praiae, whether the hand

‘Or shear the hope of years. But choioe to die
‘ls thrust not on the mind-we oannot flee;
‘See at our threan, e’en now, our kinsmen's swords.

‘At least in war's blind cloud we shall not fall;
‘Nor when the flying weapons hide the day,
‘And slaughtered heaps of foemen load the field, ooo
‘And death is oommon‚ and the brave man siuks
‘Unknown, inglorious. Us within this ship,
‘Seen of both friends and foas, the gods have plaoed3
‘Both land and sea and island cliffs shall bear,
‘From either shore, their witness to our death,
‘ln which some great and memorable fame
‘'Phou, Fortuna, dost prepare. What glorious deeds
‘Of warlike heroism‚ of noble saith,
‘Time's aunals show! All these shall we surpm.
‘True, Coesar, that to fall upon our swords oso
