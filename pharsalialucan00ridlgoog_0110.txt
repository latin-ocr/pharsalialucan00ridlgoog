aooxm MASSILIA

Harmless upon a roof, so long the stenes

Crushed down innocuous; but as the blows

Reined iierce and cesseleas and the Romans tired,
Some here and there sank iainting. Next the roos
Moves on with earth bespnnkled: underneath

The ram conceals his head, which, poised and awung,

They dash with mighty force upon the wall,
Covered themselves with mantlets. Though the head 550
Light on the lower atones, yet as the shock
Falla and refelle, from battlement to base
The rampart soon shall topple. But by balks
And rocky fragments overwhelmed, and flames,
The roos at length gives way; and worn with toil
All spent in vain, the wearied troops withdraw
And seek the shelter of their tenta again.
Thus fer to hold their battlements was all
The Greeks had hoped; now, venturing attach,
, With glittering torches ior their arms, by night 500
Fearless they sallied forth: nor lance they bear
Nor deadly bow, nor shast ς sor fire alone
Is now their weapon. Through the Roman works
Driven by the wind the conflagmtion spread:
Nor did the newness of the wood make pause
The iury of the flames, which, fed ahesh
By living torchea, 'naath a smoky pall
Leaped on in fiery tongues. Not wood alone
But stones gigantis crumbling into dost
Dissolved beneath the heat; the mighty mound 570
Lay prone, yet in its ruin lerger seemed.
Next, conquered on the land, upon the main
They try their fortunea On their simple erait
No painted figure-head adorned the bows
Nor claimed protection from the gods3 but rude,
J ust as they fell upon their mountain homas,
