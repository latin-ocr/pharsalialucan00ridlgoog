PHARSALIA 1³00: v111

Most nearly balancas the varying hours, 6³⁰
Once only equal; for the wintry day

Repays to night her losses of the spring 3

And Magnus learning that th' Egyptian king

Or flagged his canvas, thither steered his ship.

Already hed a hoaeman from the shore

Brought news their guest was come. Short was the time
For counsel given ; but in haste were met
All who advised the base Pelloean king, 6⁴⁰

Less harah in falling years, in Memphis born
0f empty ritas, and guardian of the rise¹
Of fertilising Nile. While he was priest
Not only once had Apis² lived the space
Marked hythe crescent on his sacred brow.
First was his voice, for Magnus raised and troth
And for the pledges of the king deceased:

‘ Make many guilty, Ptolemaeus king.
‘ And faith thus lauded ³ brings its punishment
‘ When it supporta the fallen. To the fatas
‘ Yield thee, and to the gods; the wretched shun
‘ But seek the happy. As the stars from earth
‘ Differ, and fire from ocean, so from right
