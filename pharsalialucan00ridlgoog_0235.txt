206 PHARSALIA Boon v11

Thus alike with 1100110 adame
Moved either host 10 battle, one in sear
And 00010 hope 01 001ρί00. These 1100100101] do
Such work 00 001 the rolling oenturies, 400
Not 011 mankind, though free from sword and war,
shall e'er make good. Nations 11101 were 10 live
This fight shall crush, and peoploe pre-ordained
To make the history 01 the coming world
Shall come 001 10 the birth. The 10110 000100
shall sound as 1011100 10 the 0010 01 0100,
And ruins loaded with the dust of years
Shall hardly mark 1101011100. Alba's hill,
Home 01 001 gods, no human 1001011011 troad,
Save 01 some Senator 01 1110 nightly 10001 410
By Numa's orders founded-he compelled
Sernes his high offioe.¹ Void end desolate
Are Veii, Cora and Laurentum's hold;
Yet not the tooth 01 0001000 11100 destroyed
These storied monuments-'tneo civil war
Thnt rasod their citadels. Where now 1100 fled
The teeming 1110 that once 110110 knew?
Not all the earth 000 furnish her with men:
Untenanted her dwellings and her lields:
Slaves till her soil: one city holds 00 011 : 400
Crumbling to ruin, the ancestral roof
Pindo none 00 whom 10 1011; and Rome herself,
Void 01 her citizens, drawn within her gates
The dregs 01 all the world. Thet 0000 might wnge
A civil war again, thus deeply drank
Pharsalin's light the life-blood 01 her sons.

Dark 10 1110 calendar 01 Rome for aye,
The days when Allia end Cennoe fell:
