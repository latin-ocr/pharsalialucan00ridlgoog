PHARSALIA Boon v

Which that day fell, the Ooeen's blows had breved 1
What losty pesks did venquished earth resign 1

And yet on yonder coast such mighty waves

Took not their 110ος from distant regions come 710
Those monster billows, driven on their course

By thet great current which surrounde the world.¹

Thus did the King of vaen, when length of years
Wore out the forces of his thunder, cell

His brother's trident to his help, what time

The earth and see one second kingdom formed

And ocean knew no limit but the sky.
Now, too, the 000 had risen to the stars

ln mighty mass, hod not Olympus' chief
Pressed down its weves with clouds: that night from
heaven 700
Came not, es others3 but the murky eir
W as dim with pellor of the reelms below ς’
The sky lay on the deep ς within the clouds
The waves received the rein : the lightning ilnsh
Clove through the perted eir a path obscuoed
By mist end darkness: end the heavenly veults
lte-echoed to the tumult, and the 1101110
Τ1101 holds the sky was shaken. Nature secred
Chaos returned, es though the elements
Hed burst their bouds, end night hed corne to rnix 730
Th' infernal shedes with heaven,
In such turmoil
Not to 110νο perished was their only hope,
Fer as from leucas point the placid main
Spreads to the horizon, from the billow's erest
