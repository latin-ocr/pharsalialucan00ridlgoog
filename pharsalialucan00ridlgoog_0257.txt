228 PHARSALIA soor v111

Τοο long had meat Pompeius from the height

Of human glory‚ envied of mankind,
Looloed on all others 3 nor for him henoeforth

Could life be lowly. The honours of his youth
Τοο early thrust upon him, and the doeda
Which brought him triumph in the Sullan days,
His conquering navy and the Pontio war, to
Made heavier now the burden of defeat,
And orushed his pondering soul. So length of days
Drags down the haughty spirit, and life prolonged
When power has fled. Unleas when honour faila
Comes end of life, and timely death forestalls
Ensuing woe, the glory oi pest years
Is present shame. Who'd venture on the sea
0f favouring fortune but for death at naed?
Hard by Peneus' flood he reached the main
Now with Pharsalus' slaughter blushing red: 4ο
And borne in sloop, to shallows of a stream
Soaroe equal, dared the deep: Liburnia's loni,
Lord os Cilicia, at whose countless oers
Yet leucas' inleta and Corcyra shook,
Crept to the shelter of a tiny harh.
For thou didst beckon him to Lesbos' shores,
Thou, partner oi the sorrows of thy iord,
Cornelia! Sadder sar thy lise apart
'lirun wert thou present in Thessalia's fields.
Raoked is thy heart with presagea of ill; σο
Pharsalia filla thy dreams; and when the shadea
Give place to dawn, with hasty step thou tread'st
Some cliff sea-beaten, and with gaze intent
'fo mark the sail of each approaching ship
Art first: yet dar'st not ask thy husband's fate.

Lo! the ship eomes, her load os ills rmknowm
'Ihy worst of fears some mesaenger oi woe,
