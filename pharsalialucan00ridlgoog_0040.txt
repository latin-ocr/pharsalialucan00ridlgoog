Βοοιῐ THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON 9

With feeble roote still clinge3 its naked arms
And hollow trunk, though leallese, give a shade3
And though condemned beneath the tempeet'r shock
To npeedy fall, amid the eturdiertreee roo
In sacred grandeur rules the foreat still.
No such repnte had Caesar non, nor iame3

μ But energy was his that oould not rest-
The only ahame he knew was not to nin.
Keen and unvanquiehed,¹ where revenge or hope
Might call, resistleas would he stn'ke the blow
With aword unpitying: every victory won
Reaped to the full; the favour oi the gode
Praesed to the utmost; all that suyed his morse
Aimed at the summit oi power, nas thrust aeide: 17⁰
Triumph his joy, though ruin marked his traek.
As parts the clouds a bolt by windo compelled,
With oraek of riven air and eraah oi worlds,
And veile the light oi day, end on mankind,
Blasting their vision with its flames oblique,
Sheds deadly fright3 then turning to its home,
Nought but the air opposing, through ita path
Spreads havoo, and collecta its soattered fires.

'Such were the hidden motives of the ohiefs;

But in the public life the seeds oi war 18⁰
Their hold had taken, such as are the doom
Os potent natione ε and when fortune poured
Through Roman gates the hooty of a world,
The curae of luxmy, chief bane of states,
Fell on her sons. Farewell the ancient ways !
Behold the pomp profuse, the houses deeked
With omament3 their hunger loathed the iood
