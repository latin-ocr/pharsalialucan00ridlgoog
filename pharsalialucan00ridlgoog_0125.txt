lts ancient marks; no mone in middle air

The moisture hung, but fmm about the stan

Are borne Britannia's nations3 and when Nile

Fills all the land, are Memphis' thirsty reads

Shaped into fragile bosts that swim his naves.

The fallen forest, and to form the arch

By which imperious Siooris shall be spanned.

And win their conquests at the point ol sword.
