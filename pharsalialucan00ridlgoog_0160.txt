ΒοοιιῐΥ THE ORACLE

‘Thou sholt possess the hoilow in the coest
‘Of vost Euboeo’ Thus she speie, no more.

Ye mystis tripoda, guardians of the futes
And Paean, thou, from whom no day is hid
By heaven's high rulers, Masber of the truth,
Why foar'st thou to reveni the deoths of iringa,
Rome's murriered princes, ond the latest doonr
Of her great Empire witering to its fall,
And all the bloodshed of that western land?
Were yet the stars in doubt on Magnus' fate 2⁴0
Not yet decreed‚ and did the gode yet shrink
From that, the greatest crime? Or wert thou dumb
Thot Fortune'e sword for civil strise might wreak
Just vengemoe, ond a Brutus' arm onoe more
Strike down the tymni?

From the temple doors
Rushed forth the prophetess in irenzy driven,
Not all her knowledge uttemd; ond her eyes,
Still troubled by the god who reigned within,
Or filled with wild affiighn or iired with roge
Gaze on the wide expense: still workshe1·face 25⁰
Convulsive; on her cheeks o crimson biush
With ghastly pallor blent, though notos seor.
Her weary heari throbs ever; ond as neos
Boom swollen by northern winds‚ she finds in sighs,
All inarticuiahe, relies. But while
She hostes from that dread light in which she saw
'lhe sanes, to oommon day, lo! on herpath
The darkness fell. Then by a Stygian draught
Os the forgetful river, Phoebus snatched
Book from her soul his seoreis3 and she fell eoo
Yet hardly living.
Nor did Appius dread

Appronching death, but by dark oracles
