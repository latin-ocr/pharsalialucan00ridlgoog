Boot IX CATO

‘ Scorched, and the zone most torrid: let us fall

‘ Slein by some heavenly cause, and from the sky

‘ Descend our fate! Not, Africa, of thee

‘ Complain we, nor oi Nature. From mankind

‘ Cut off, this quarter, teeming thus with peste

‘ She gave to snakes, end to the barren fields

‘ Denied the husbandmen, nor wished thot men

‘ Should perish by their venom. To the reolms

‘ Of serpenti have we come. Heter of men,

‘ Receive thy vengeanoe, whoso oi the gods 101⁰
‘ Severed this region upon either hand,

‘ With death in middle space. Our march isset

‘ Through thy sequestered kingdom, end the host

‘ Which knows thy secret noeirs the furthert world.
‘ Perchnnce some greater wonders on our path

‘ May etill aweit usr in the waves be plunged

‘ Heeven's constellatione, and the losty pole

‘ Stoop from its height. By further space removed
‘ No land, than Juba’s malm by rumour's voice

‘ Drear, moumhrl. Haply for this serpent land 1⁰2⁰
‘ There may we long, where yet some living thing

‘ Gives consolation. Not my notive land

‘ Nor Eumpean fields 1 hope for now

‘ Lit by fer other suns, nor Aria's plnins.

‘ But in what land, what region of the sky,
‘Where lest we Africa? But now with frosts

‘ Cyrene stiffened: have we changed the lewe

‘ Which rule the serrone, in this little space?

‘ Cast from the world we know, 'neoth other siries

‘ And stare we tread3 behind our becks the home 1030
‘Of southern tempests: Rome herself perchance

‘ Now lies beneath our ieet. Yet for our fetes

‘ This soloce pray we, thet on thir our trech

‘ Pureuing Caeser with his host may come.'
