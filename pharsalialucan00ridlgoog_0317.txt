288 PHARSALIA Βοοι 1x

Lsy all the monster, for such total rest
To her were death-so fated z serpent looks

In vigilant wateh‚ eome reaching forth defend

Her head, while others lay upon her face

And elumbering eyes. Then hero Perseus shooh
Though turned averse; trembled his dexter hand:

But Pallas held, and the deseending blado

Shore the broad neck whence sprang the viper brood.
What visage bore the Gorgon as the steel

Thus reft her life! what poison frum her throst
Breathed ! from her eyes what venom of death distilled !
The goddess dared not look, and Perseus' face ⁸⁰0
Had huten, averse‚had not Athena veiled

With ooils of writhing snakes the features dead.

'lhen with the Gorgon head the hero ilew

Uplilted on his wings and sought the sky.

Shorter had been his voyage through the midst

0f Europe's cities; but Athena bade

To spare her peoples and their fmitful lands;

For who when such an airy oourser passed

Had not looked up to heaven? Western vinds

Now eped his pinions‚ and he took his course ⁸10
O'er Libya's regiona, fiam the stara and suns

Veiled by no culture. Phoebus' nearer track

There burns the soil, and lostiest on the sky ¹

There falls the night, to shade the wandering moon,

Il' e’er lorgetful of her oourse oblique,

Straight through the stara, nor bending to the North
Nor to the South, she hastens. Yet that earth,

In nothing fertile, void oi fmitful yield,

Drank in the poison of Medusa’s blood,

¹ Tho idea seems to be that the earth, bulging at the equator, oasts its
ohsdow highest on the sky: and that the moon becomes eclipsed by lt
wbenever obe follows a straight path instead of an oblique one, which may
hoppen lrom her {orgetfulness (hir. Haskins’s note).
