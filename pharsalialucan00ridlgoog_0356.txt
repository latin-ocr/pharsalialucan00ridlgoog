Boos x cAEsAR IN EGYPT 3527

To seize the orucial moment of the war.
Quick in the darhest watches of the night
He leaped upon his ships, and Pharos ¹ seized‚
Gaia of the main3 an island in the days
of Pmteus seer, now boidering the walls
0f Alexander's city. Thus he gained 020
A double vaninge, ior his ioes were pent
Within the narrow entrance, which for him
And for his aids gave acoess to the sea.
Nor longer was Pothinus' doom delayed,
Yet noi with cross or ilame, norwith the wrath
His crime demanded ; nor by savage bea-sis
Tom, did he suffer ; but by Magnus' death,
Ales the shame! he fell; his head by swoid
Hacked from his shoulders. Next by fiands pmpared
By Ganymede her base attendant, fled sao
² Arsinoe from the Court io Caesar's ioes3
There in the absenoe oi the King she ruled
As of Lagean blood: there at her hands,
The savage minion of the tymni boy,
Achillas, fell by just avenging swosd.
Thus did another victim io shy shade
· Alone, Pompeius 3 bui the gods forbid
Thai this be all thy vengeance! Not the King
Nor all the sooch of lagos ior thy death
W ould make fit sacrifice! So Fortune deemed ς aso
And noi till pairiot swoids shall drinh the blood
Of Caesar, Magnus, shall thou be appeased.
