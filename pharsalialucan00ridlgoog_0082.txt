noo: 11 THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS 51

6 'Tis no true fight tc wreak your country's ire.

6 Was that a war when Catilina's hand

6 Listed against her rooss the flaming torch‚

‘ And, partner in his huy, Lentulus, oro
‘And med Cethegus¹ with his naked arm?

6 Is such thy madness, Caesar? when the Fates

6 With great Camillus* and Metellus* names

‘ Might place thine own, dost thou prefer tc rank

‘ With Marius and Cinna? Swift shall be

‘Thy sall: as Lepidus before the swonl

‘ Ol Catulus ; or who my axes felt,

6 Carbo: now buried in Sicanian tomb;

‘ Or who, in exile, roused Iberia's bordes,

6 Sertorius-yet, witness Heaven, with these 6⁶20
6 Ι hate to rank thee; hate the task that Rome

‘ Has laid upon me, to oppose thy rage.

6 Would that in safety from the Parthian war

‘ And Scythian steppes had conquering Crassus come!
6 'lhen haply hadst thou fallen by the hand

‘ 'llrat smote vile Spartacus the robber soe.

‘ But if among my triumphs fate has said

‘Thy conquest shall be written, know this beart

6 Still sends the life blood coursing: and this arm

6 Still vigorously flings the dart afield. 6³0
‘ He deems me slothful. Caesar, thou shalt learn

‘ We brook not peace because we legin war.

‘ Old, does he call me? Fear not ye mine age³
