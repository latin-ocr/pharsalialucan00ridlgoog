nnurn or Ponrnrus

Now through Alcides'¹ pass and Tempe's groves
Pompeius, aiming for Haemonian glens

And forests lone, urged on his wearied steed
Soaroe hesding now the spur ; by devious tracks
Seeking to veil the footsteps of his flight:

The rustle of the foliage, ond the noise

0s following comrades filled his anxious soul

Ἰ With terrors, as he fancied at his side

Some ambushed enemy. Follen from the height

Of former fortunas, still the chiefiain knew ¹ ro
His life not worthless; nrindsul of the futes:

And 'gainst the price he set on Caesar's head,

He mensures Caesur's velue of his own.

Yet, us he rode, the features of the chief
Made known his ruin. Many as they sought
The camp Pharsalico, ere yet was spread
News os the battle, met the chief, amazed,
And wondered at the whirl of human things:
Nor held disaster sure, though Magnus' sels
Told os his ruin. Every witness seen eo
Brought peril on his flight: 'twere better far
Safe in a neme obscure, through ull the world

To wanden but his ancient fame forbod.
