PHARSALIA emen

Look down upon the kingn, thy subjecte still;

Look on the reeims end citiee which they hold,

Egypt end Libya, gine from thee of yore;

And chooee the country thet befits thy death.
Larissa iimt was witness of thy fall,

Thy noble mien, es victor of the satem

And londin sorrow, yet with gine of prioe

Fit ior a conqueror flung beck her getes

And poumd her citizens forth. ‘Our homes and sanes

‘Tothoeaoeopen; would it wem our lot em

‘With thee to perish; of thy mighty name

‘ Still much eui-vives and conqueied by thyself,

‘ Thyeelf alone, still oouldst thou to the wer

⁴ All natione eall and challenge iate again?

But thus he epeke: ‘To eitiee nor to men

‘Aveils the oonqueied ought : then pledge your saith

‘ Το him who hes the victory! Cesar still

Trod deep in pileo oi sleughter on the field,

His country's vitals, while his denghter's sponse

'ihus gave him kingdoms. But Pompeius fled eoo

'Mid sobe and gruans end blaming of the gods

For this their heroe commandment; and he ssed

Full of the fruits and knowledge of the love
'lhe peoplee bore him, which he knew not his
In times oi happiness.

When Italian blood
Flowed deep enough upon the fatal field,
(jesar gave mercy to the meener crowd
Whoee deoths were vain. But that the hostile comp
Might not monii the foe, nor calm of night
Banish their seem, he bids his cohorte dash, eoo
While Fortnne glowed and terror filled the plain,
Straight on the ramparn oi the conqueied foe.
Light ivos the took to urge them to the spoil
