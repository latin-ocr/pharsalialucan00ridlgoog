1³00: vu THE BA'ITLE

‘ All means of victory. Noble men heve sought
‘ Unesked the riske of wer. Our soldiers boost
6 Anoestral statues. If to us were given
6 A Curius, if Camillus were returned,
‘ Or patriot Decius to devote his life,
‘ Here would they take their stand. From furtheet east 400
6 All natione gothemd, eities os the send
6 Unnumbered‚ give their aid: 0 world complete
‘ Serves 'neoth our standards. North end south and all
‘ Who hove their being 'neoth the starry veult,
‘ Here meet in arms conjoined: und shall we not
6 Crush with our closing wings this poltry foe?
‘ Few shall lind room ιο strike; the rest with voioe
‘ Must be content ιο nid: for Caesar's ranks
‘Suffice not for us. Think from Rome's high wells
‘ The metrone wetch you with their hair unbound; 440
6 Think that the Senate honr, ιοο old for arms,
‘ With snowy looks outspreod3 and Rome herself,
6 The world's high mistress, feering now, elas!
‘ A despot-ell exhort you ιο the light.
‘ Think thet the people that is ond that shall be
‘ J oins in the prayer-in freedom to be born,
6 In freedom die, their wish. lf 'mid these von-s
‘ Be still found pleoe for mine, with wife end child,
‘ So far as Imperator may, 1 bend
6 Before you suppliont-unless this fight 450
⁴ Be won, behold me exile, your dhgraoe,
‘ My kinemen's soom. From this, 'tis yours to sore.
‘ Then seve! Nor in the latest stage of lile,
6 Let Magnus be e slave?
'lhen burned their souls

At these his words, indignant at the thought,

And Rome rose up within them, end to die

Wos welcome.
