uuor 111 MASSILIA 77

Rumbled with earthquakes‚ that the prostrate yew
Roae up again ; that fiery tongues of flame

Gleamed in the forest depths, yet were the trees
Unkiudled3 and that snakes in frequent folds

Were coiled around the trunks. Men flee the apot 480
Nor dure to worship near: and e'en the priest

Or when bright Phoebus holds the height, or when
Dark night controls the heavens, in anxious dread
Draws near the grove and seara to find ita lord.
Spared in the former war, still dense it rose

Where all the hillo were bare, and Caesar now

Ita fall commanded. But the brawny arms

Which awayed the axes trembled, and the rnen,
Awed by the sacred grove's dark majesty‚

Held back the blow they thought would be returned. 490
This Caesar saw, and swist within his grasp

Uprose a ponderous axe, which downward fell
Cleaving a mighty oak that towered to heaven,
While thus he spake: ‘choeforth let no man dread
‘To fell this forest : all the crime is mine.
‘This be your creed.’ He spele, and all obeyed,

For Caesar's ire weighed down the wrath of Heaven.
Yet oeased they not to fear. Then first the oak,
Dodona's ancient boast; the knotty holm 3

The cyprees, witness of patriciau grief, ooo
The buoyant older, laid their foliage low

Admitting day; though scarcely through the sterns
Their fall found passage. At the eight the Gauls
Grieved; but the garrison within the walls
Rejoioed: for thus shall men insult the goda

And find no punishment? Yet fortune oft

Protecta the guilty ; on the poor alone

The gode can vent their ire. Euough hewn down,
They seize the country wagons3 and the hiud,
