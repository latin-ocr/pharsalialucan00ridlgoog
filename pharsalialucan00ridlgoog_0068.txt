Βοοι 11 THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS 37

6 Dlew from the city ; for the surgeon knife
· ‘ Which shore the oeneerous limbo eut in too deep,
‘And shed the life eneam from still heelthy veios.
6 Tme that the guilty fell, but not before
‘All eloe hed perished. Hetred hed free course 170

6 Fell heedlong down upon the unpitying earth,
‘ And from the encrimsoned victor snatehed his death ε
6 One built his funeral pyoe and oped his veios,

6 Dmy had touched the features of the slnin
‘ When round the mouldering henp‚ with trembling steps
‘The grief-struck parente sought and stole their deed.
‘ 1, too, the body of my brother elain
‘Thought to remove, my victim to the peeoe
