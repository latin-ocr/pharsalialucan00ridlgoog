Βοοι x CAESAR IN EGYPT 311

‘ Shsme on the earth ond thee that Magnus death
‘ Should be Pothinus' triumph or his guilt'
Her words were nothing to his stubborn enr3

Her face achieved the prayer, her wauton smile,

The long voluptuous night 01 shsme untold:

So did she bn'be her judge3 so Caesar fell.
When she had puruhused ot so vost 0 prioe

Pence from the chief,¹ the joys 01 such 0 peace
A feast prodnimed. There in full pomp the Queen
Displayed her luxuries, 00 yet unknown 100
To Roman manners. Specious rose the hall
Like to such fane 00 this corrupted age
shall scarcely reor: the losty oeiling shone
With richest uneery, the benms were bound
ln golden ooverings3 no scant veneer
Lny on its walls, but built in solid blooks
Os marble, gleemed the phinee. Agete stood
ln sturdy columns, bearing up the roof ς
Onyx oud porphyry on the specious floor
Were trodden 'neath the font, the mighty gotes uo
01 Marde's ebony throughout were formed,
No mere edornment3 ivory clothed theban,
Studded with emeruld spots; upon the doors
Gleemed polished tortoise shells hum Indinn sees:
And genis 01 prioe ond yellow jasper shone
On conch and ooverlet, whose greater part
Dipped more than onoe within the vats of Tyro
Had drunk their juioe; and port were feethered gold ;
Part crimson dyed, in manner us ure possed
Through Phanion leash the threads. There waited slaves
In number as 0 people some in ranke 1⁶1
By different blood distinguished, some by age3
This haud with Libyan, that with auburn hair
¹ Reading ‘ducis’ (Francken).
