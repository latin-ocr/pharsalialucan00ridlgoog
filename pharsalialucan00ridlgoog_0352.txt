Βοοι x cAESAR IN EGYPT 323

0f Intian racc the most part of his hrain,

Yet to barbarian customs were their minda

By long forgetfulness of Rome debased: ⁴9⁰
Else had it shamed to serve the Pharian King;

But now his vasaal and his minion'a word

Compel obedience. 'Ihose who serve in campa

Lose faith and love of kin : their pittanae earned ¹
Makes just the deed: and for their sordid pay,

Not for themselves, they threaten Caesar's life.

Where finds the piteous destiny of the realm

Rome with herself at peace? The host withdrawn
From dread Thessalia caves on Nilus' banks

As all the race of Rome. What more had dared, ⁶00
With Magnus weloomed, the Ingean house?

Each hand must render to the goda their due,

Nor son of Rome may oease from civil war3
By Heaven's command our stale was rent in twain3
Nor love for husband nor reganl for sire
Parted our peoples. Twas a slave who stiroed
Afresh the conflict, and Achillas graaped
ln turn the swonl of Rome: nay more, had won,
Had not the faces adverae restrained his hand
From Coemr's slaughter.

For the murderous pair 510
Ripe for their plot were met3 the spacious hall
Still busied with the feast. So might have flowed
Into the kingly cupa a stream of gom,
And in mid banquet fallen Coeaar's head.
Yet did they sear leat in the nightly strife
(The fates permitting) some incautione hand-
So did they trust the anoni-might slay the King.
Thus stayed the daed, for in the minda of slaves
The chance of doing Caesar to the death .
