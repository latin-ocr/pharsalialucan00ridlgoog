‘ And here thy monarchs, and e suppliont world

‘ Entmots thee prostrate for thy hinsmsn's fall.
‘ So long shall Cesar plunge the world in wer?
‘ Swist was thy tread when these proud notions fell;
‘ How deep their shnnm, and justly, should delay
‘Now mar thy conquests! Where thy trust in Fete,
‘ Thy fervour where? Ingrato ! Dost dread the gods,
‘ Or think they favour not the Senate's cause?
‘ ΤΙιγ troops unhidden shall the standands seioe
‘ And oonquer; thou in shsme be foroed to win. so
‘ lf et the Senote's orders and for us
‘The war is urged, then give to us the right
‘To choose the battle-field. Why dost thou keep
‘From Caesar's throst the swords of all the world?
‘The weapon quivers in the esger hand:
‘ Scor-ee one eweits the signal. Strike ot onoe,
‘ Or without thee the trumpets sound the frey.
‘ Art thou the Senote's comrade or her lord?
‘ We wsit your answer?
But Pompeius grosned;

His mind was adverse, but he felt the fetes roo

Opposed his wish‚ ond knew the hand divine.
‘ Sinos all desire it, and the fetes prevsil,
‘ So let it be; your leader now no more,
‘ 1 share the labours of the battle-field.
‘Let Fortune roll the notione ol the earth
‘ In one red ruin; myrlods of mankind
‘See their lest sun todey. Yet, Rome, 1 sweer‚
‘ This day of blood was forced upon thy son.
‘ Without e wound, the prizes of the war
‘Might heve been thine, and he who broke the pesoe 110
‘ ln peeoe forgotten. Whence this lust for crime?
‘ Shall hloodless victories in civil war
‘ Be shunned, not sought? We've ravished from our foe
