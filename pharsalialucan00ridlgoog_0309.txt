Hes seired upon its prey‚ in volumes dense

110le np the smoke, and darkens all the air. Δ
Then with fresh might he fell upon the host oro
0f marching Romans, snatching from their feet
The send they trnd. Had Auster been enclosed
In some vest cavemous vault with solid walls

And mighty berners, he had moved the world
Upon its ancient base and mede the lande

To tremble: but the facile Libyan soil

By not resisting stood, and blosts that whirled
The surface upwnrds lest the depths unmoved.
Helmet and shield and spenr were torn arvny

By his most violent brenth, and borne alost ⁶⁵⁰
Thmugh nll the regions of the boundlees sky-3
Perchance e wonder in some distant land,

Where men may sear the weepons from the heaven
There falling, es the armour of the gods,

Nor deem thern ravished from a soldier's arm.

Those shields descended which our chosen priests¹
Beor on their shoulders; from some warlike rece
By tempest rapt, to be the prize of Rome.

While thus the tempeet whirled the earth alost eoo
Prone fell the host, and wound their garmente tight,
And gripped the soih but hardly thus prevailed.
Weight had not held them sefe3 the rngIng blnst
Piles heops upon them, their recumbent limbo
Are whelmed in send. At length they struggling rose
Beck to their feet, when lo! around thern stood,
