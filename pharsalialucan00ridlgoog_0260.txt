But now upon the shore 1 numerous bend

From Mitylene thus epproeched the chief :
‘ 11 'tis our'greatoet glory to have kept
1 The pledge with us by such 1 husband plnoed‚
1 Ι)0 thou one night within these friendly wells
‘ We prey thee, stny; thus honouring the homes 1³0

‘ This spot in days to come the guest from Rome
‘For thee shnll honour. Nowhere shnlt thou find
1 Α suren refuge in defeat. All else
‘ May court the viotor's favour3 we long sinoe
‘ Have earned his chestisement And though our isle
‘ Rides on the deep, girt by the ocean were,
1 No ships hns Coeser: and to us shall oome,
‘ Be sure, thy captains, to our trusted shore,
‘ The wer renewing. Tele, 101 ull is thine, uo
‘ The treeeures 01 our temples end the gold,

‘ Not in his 1111 10 leave her.' Pleused in soul

At such 1 love, und joyed that in the world
Some 111111 still lingered, thus Pompeius naid:
