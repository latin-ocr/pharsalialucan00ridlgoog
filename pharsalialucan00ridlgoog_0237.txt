208 PHARSALIA soonam

Italia's peoples! Did the Bruti atrike 100
10 vain for liberty? Why 1000 and rights

Sanctioned by all the annals designate

With consular titles? Happier 100 the Medes

And blest Arabia, and the Baetem lands

Held by a kindlier sate in despot rule!

'l'hat nation serves the 00001 which serves with shame.
No guardian gods wateh over us from heaven:

J ove¹ is no king; let ages whirl along

In blind confusion: from his throne supreme

Shall he behold such oamage and restrain 110
His thunderbolts? 00 Mimas shall he hurl

His fines, on Rhodope and OEta's woods

Unmeriting such chastisement, and leave

This life to Cassius* hand? On Argos fell

At grim Thyestes' feast’ untimely night

By him thus hastened; shall 'l'hesaalia's land

Reoeive full daylight, wielding kindred swords

In fathers* hands and brothers'? Carelees 01 men

Are all the gods. Yet 100 this day of doom

Such rengeanoe have we reaped as deities 140
May give to 0000101ος 100 these 0000 shall raise

OurpartedCaesarstothegods; andRome
shall deck their effigies with thunderbolts,
And 01000 and mys, and in the very sanes
Swear by the shades 01 men.

With swift adranoe
They seize the space that yet delays the 10100
Till short the span dividing. Then they gase
For one short moment where may fall the spem,

What hand may deal their death, what monstrous task
Soon shall be theirs; and all in arms they see, 550
