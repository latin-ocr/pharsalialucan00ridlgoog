PHARSALIA noos vm

6 Untipped with poison z from the raneorous edge
6 The slightest wound deals death.
Would that my lot
‘ Foroed me not thus io trust that savage raee
‘ Of Arsaces !² Yet now their emulous fate
6 Contende with Roman destinies: the gods
‘Smile favouring on their nation. Thence Pll pom· aso
6 On Caesar peoples from another earth
6 And all the Orient ravished from its home.
‘ But should lhe East and barborous treaties fail,
6 Faie, bear our shipvrecked fortunes past the bounds
6 Oi earth, es knovn io men. The kings 1 made
‘ Ι supplicate not, but in death shall lake
6 Το oiher spherae this soloce, chief of alh
‘ His hands, my kinsman'e, never shed my blood
‘ Nor sooihed me dying. Yet as my mind in turn
6 The varying fortunes of my life recalls, ³6⁰
‘ How was Ι glorious in that Eastern world!
‘ How great my name by sar Moeotis marsh
6 And where swift Tanais flows! No other land
6 Has so resounded with my conquests von,
6 So sent me home triumphant. Rome, do thou

‘ Approve my enterprise! What happier chance

6 Could favouring gods afford thee? Parthian hosts

6 Shall fight the civil wars os Rome, end share

‘ Her ills, and sall enfeebled. When the arms

6 Of Coesar meet with Parthian in the frey, ayo
‘Then must kind Fortune vindicate my loi

‘ Or Crassus be avenged?

¹ Dion ooold not believe it possible that Pompeios ever oontemplated
taking refuge in Parthia, but Plutarch states lt as a iaot; and says thot it
was Theophanes oi Lesbos who dissuaded him imm doing so. (6 Pomp,' 76.)
Mommsen (vol. iv.. pp. 421-423) dimosses the subject, aod says that irom
Parthis only could Pompeius have attempted to seeh support, and that
sooh an attempt. putting the objections to lt asida. would probably have
iailal. Lucan's symphthies vvere probably with Lentulus.
