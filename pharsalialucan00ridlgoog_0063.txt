PHARSALIA

Lay deep in every bosom ε as when death
Knocks at some door but enters not as yet,
Before the mother calls the name aloud
Or bids her grieving maidens beat the breast
While still she marks the glazing eye, and soothes
The stiffening limbs and gazeo on the sace, so
ln dread, not sorrow yet, in wondering awe
Of death approaching: and with mind distraught
Clings to the dying in a last embrace.

The matrone laid aside their wonted gerb:
Crowds filled the temples-on the unpitying stones
Some dashed their bosoms; others bathed with tears
The statues of the gods ; some tore their bair
Upon the holy threshold and with shrieks
And vows unoeasing called upon the names
Ol those whom mortals supplioate. Nor all 40
Lay in the 'lhunderer's sane: at every sbrius
Some prayers were offered which refused would bring
Reproach on heaven. One whose livid arms
Wene dark with blows, whose eheeks with tears bedewed‚
Cried, ‘ Now, unhappy methea, rend the look,

‘ Nor keep your sorrows till the battle day:
‘ Now ye may weep: when either ehiestain wins
‘ Rejoice ye must? Thus sorrow stirs iuelf.

Meanwhile the men in seeking either oamp
And mamhing onward in the path to war, oo
Addrees the eruel gods in just complaint.

‘ Happy the youths who born in Punic days

‘ On Cannae's uplands or by Trebia's stream

‘ Fought and were alain! What wretched lot is ours!
‘ No peaoe we ask for: let the natione rage;

‘ Rouse fieroest citios ! may the world find arms

‘ To wage a war with Rome: let Parthian hosts

‘ Rush forth hom Susa; Soythian later curb
