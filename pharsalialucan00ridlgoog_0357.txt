PHARSALIA noo-x

Sank not their roge: m'th Ganymede sor chief
Agein they rush to erms; in deede of fight
Agein they oonquer. So might that one day
Have witnessed Coeser's fate3 eo might its seme
Have lived through egee

As the Roman Chief,
Crushed on the nanow surfeoe of the mole,
Prepmed to throw his troops upon the ships, ooo
Sudden upon him the surmunding foee
With ell their terrore neme In dense erray
Their navy lined the ehooes, while on the rear
The sootmen ceeselees charged. No hope was lest,
For ssight wne not, nor oould the breve men's erm
Achieve or enfety or a glorious death.
Not now were needed for ζωαὶ Caeeer's fall,
Caught in the toils of nature, routed host
Or mighty heeps of elain ε his only doubt
To sear or hope for death: while on his brein eoo
Breve Seoeva's image flanhed, now veinly eought,
Who on the well by Epidamnus' fieldn
Eamed fame immortnI, end with single arm

Drove back Pompeius es he trod the brench.
