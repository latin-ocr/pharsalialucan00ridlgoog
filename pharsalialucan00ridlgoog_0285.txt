256 PHARSALIA . 1³00- suu

Pours in upon them, and in shallow trench
Commits them to the earth; aud lest some breeae sao
Might bear away the ashes, or by chance
Some sailor's anchor might distrub the tomb‚
A stone he places, aud with stick half burued
'Ihaces the sacred name : Here Mopsus lies.
And art thou, Fortuna pleased that such a spot
Should be his tomb which even essars self
Had chosen‚ rather than permit his oorse
To rest unburied? Why, with thoughtless hand
Confine his shade within the narrow bouuds
Of this poor sepulchre? Where the furthest saud 93⁰
llangs on the margin of the baffled deep
Cabined he lien yet where the Roman name
Is known, and Empire‚ such in truth shall be
The bouudless measure of his testing-place.
Blot out this stoue, this proof against the gods!
OEta finds room for Hercules alone,
And Nysa's mountain for the Bromian god ; ¹
Not all the lands of Egypt should suffice
For Magnus dead: and shall one Pharian stone
Marlr his remains? Yet should no turi disclose sao
His title, peoples of the earth would sear
To spuru his ashes, and the sends of Nile
No foot would tread. But if the stone deserves
So great a name, theu add his mighty deeds:
Write Lepidus conquercd and the Alpine war,
And fleme Sertorius by his aiding arm
O'erthrown; the chariots which as knight he drove 3²
Cilician pirates driven hom the main,
And Commeroe safe to nations; Eastern kings
¹ Dionysus. But this god. though brought up by the nympha ol Mouut

Nysa. was not supposed to have been buried there
² See Book vu.. lius 20.
