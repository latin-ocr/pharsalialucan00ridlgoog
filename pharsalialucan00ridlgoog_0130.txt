Boos Ν CAESAR IN SPAIN 101

'lhe gods do favour thee. Thoesalian fields
Geve thee uo better fortune, nor the wavee
That lave Massilie3 nor ou Pharos' moin

‘ Cost me no b100d; he falls not without price

Drew down her starry veil und sank the sun.
Thus keener fights the gladiator whose wound

Still gives the sinews motion, ere the ahin
