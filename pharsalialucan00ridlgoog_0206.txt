Βοοι vl THE WITCH OF THESSALIA 177

Or parting entrail. By unnatural means

Wombs yield to her the infant to be plaoed
On glowing altars: and whene'er she needs

Some fieroe undaunted ghost, he foils not her ooo
Whohasalldeathsinuse. Herhaudhaschesed

From smiling cheeks the rosy bloom of life;
And with sinister hand from dying youth
Has shorn the fatal lock ε and holding ost
In foul embrsoes some departed friend

Severed the head, and through the ghastly lips,
Held by her own upari, some impious tale
Dark with mysterious horror heth oonveyed
Down to the darkness of the Stygian shades.
When Sextus first, through rumours of the place, wo
Heard of the hag, what time beueath the earth
'litan was wheeling at full height, aud here
Night in mid course, in quest of her he trod
Through desert fields. Meanwhile a faithful band,
His ministare of guilt, mid tombs and vaults
All ruined wandering‚ beheld the witch
Seated afar upon a losty crag
Where Haemus reaches out Pharsalian spurs.l
There was she proving ior her gods and priests
Of megic, words unknown, and framing charita ooo
of dire and novel purpose : for she feared
Lest Mars should stray into another world,
And spare Thessalian soil the blood ere long
To flow in torrente ; and thus she forbade

And soon ss she named her beek to the south

But more probably the meaning is that the wolfe bite gave the flesh
