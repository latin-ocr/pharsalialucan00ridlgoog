118 PHARSALIA Boon lv

Where broke the hills abruptly h> their fall

He ranks his troops and sees the foe afar:

Who still deceiving‚ simulated flighr,

Till from the height in loose unonlered linas

The Roman forces streamed upon the plain,

ln thought thar J uba fied. Then first was known 85⁰
The naeherous fraud: for swift Numidian horse

On every side surround them: lenden, men-

All see their fata in one dread moment come.

No cowerd fleas, no warrior bravely strides

To meet rhe battle: hay, the trumpet eall

Stirs not the charger with mounding hoof

To spurn the rock, nor galling bit compels

To chnmp in eagerness; nor toss his mane

And prick the aar, nor prnncing with his feet

To claim his share of eombat. Tired‚ the neck 86⁰
Droops downwnrds: emoking swaat bedews the limbs :

Dry from the squalid mouth protrudes the tongue,
Home, raueous panting issues from their chestae
Their flankn distended: and on every curb

Dry foam oi blood; the ruthless sword alone

Could move them unwani, powerleas even then
To charge ; but giving to the hostile dart
A nearer viatim. But when the Affic horse

First made their onset‚ loud beneath their hoofs
Rang the wide plain, and rose the duat in air 870
As by some Thracian whirlwind stirredr and veiled
The hearens in darkness. When on Curio's host
The rampart burst, each footman in the rank

Sinod there tn meet his fabe—no doubtful end
Hung in the balance: destiny proclaimed

Death tn them all. No conflict hand tn hand

Was granted them, by laneae thrown from far

And sidelong sword-thrusts slain: nor wounds alone,
Bur clouds of wanpons falling from the air
