PHARSALIA Boot IX

What evailed, eso
Murrus, the lance by which thou didst transflx
A Basilisk? Swift through the weapon ran
The poison to his hand: he drew his swerd
And severed arm and shoulder et e biow:
Then gazed secure upon his severed hond
Which perished as he looked. So hadst thou died,
And such had been thy fate!
Whoe'er had thought
A scorpion had strength o'er death and fate?
Yet with his threatening ooils and barb erect
He won the glory of Orion ¹ elain ; eso
So bear the stars their witness. And who worild sear
Thy ineunte, Saipuga θ’ Yet the Stygian Maids
Have given thee power to snap the fatal threads.
Thus nor the day with brightness, nor the night
With darkness gave them peace. The very eerth
On which they lay they feared; nor leaves nor straw
They piled for couches, but upon the ground
Unshielded from the fetes they laid their limbs,
Cherished benesth whose warmth in chill of night
The frozen peste found shelter; in whose jaws seo
Harmless the while, the lurking venom slept.
Nor did they know the measure of their march
Accomplished, nor their peth; the stars in heaven
Their only guide. ‘Return, ye gods‚' they cried,
ln frequent weil, ‘the arms from which we iled.
‘ Give back Thessalia„ Sworn to meet the sword
‘ Why, lingering, fall we thus? ln Caesar's place
‘ The thirsty Dipsas and the horned snake
‘ Now wege the variare. Rather let us seeir
‘ 'lhat region by the horses of the sun loeo
