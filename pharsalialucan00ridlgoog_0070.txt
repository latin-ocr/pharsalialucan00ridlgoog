Βοοι 11 THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS 39

⁸ Unshuddering sat the author of the whole,
‘Nor seaoed that at hia word such thousanda fell. 2³0
‘At length the 'Itiaoan flood received the dead-
‘The iirat upon hia wavm3 the last on those
‘That lay beneath them ; vessels in their course
‘Wene atayed, and while the lower omnent dowed
‘Yet to thesea, the upper stood on high
‘Dammed back by oamage. Through the streets mean·
while
‘ln headlong torrenta ran a tide of blood,
‘Which imnowing ita path through town and field
‘Foroed the slow river on. But now his banks
‘No longer held him, and the dead were thrown 2⁴0
‘Baok on the fields above. With labour huge
‘At length he atiuggled to his goal and stretohed
‘In orimson atieak across the Tuscan Sea.
‘For deeda like thoee, shall Sulla now be styled
“‘ Darling of Fortune,” “ Sawiour of the State ⁹⁸?
‘For these, a tomb in middle field of Mars
‘Reconl his fame? Like horrors now oetmn
‘For us to suffen and the civil war
‘Thus shall be waged again and thus shall end.
‘Yet worse disasters may our seara suggest, 25⁰
‘For now with gieater oarnage of mankind
‘The rival hosta in weightier battle meet.
‘To exiled Man‘ua, the pn'ze of war
‘Was Rome regained ; triumphant Sulla knew
‘No gieater joy than on his hated foen
‘To wneak his vengeance with unaparing awond.
‘But these more powerful rivola Fortune oalls
‘To worse ambitions; nor would either chief

‘For auch rewaid as Sulla's wage the war?
Thus, mindful of his youth, the aged man ooo

Wept for the past, but ieaned the ooming days.
