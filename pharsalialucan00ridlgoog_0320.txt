Boot 1x CATO

Nor any¹ evil; but the poison gerni
In silence working aa consuming fioe
Absorbed the molatura of his inward frama,
Draining the natural juioas that were spread
Around his vitais 3 in his arid jana
Sat ilame upon his tongue: his woaried linia
No sweat hadewed; dried up, the fount of tears
Flod from his eyalids. Tortured by tha tire
Nor Cato's stammas, nor of his sacred charge 000
The honour oould withhold him ς but he darad
To dash his standard down, and through the plains
Raging, to seek sor water that might alaha
The fatal venom thirsting at hia beart.
Plunge him in Tanais, in Rhone and Po,
Pour on his burning tongue the flood of Nile,
Yet wera tha fire unquenched. So sall tha lang
0f Dipsas in the torrid Libyan lands;
In other elimas lasa fatal. Naxt he aaaks
Amid the sanda, all barren to the depths‚ aaa
For moistura: then returning to tha shoala
Lapa tham with grand-in vain-the briny draught
Soaroe quenched the thirst it made. Nor knowing yet
The poison in his frama, he strela himself
To rip his swollan veina and drink tha gora.
Cato bida lift the standard, last his troops
May find in thirat a pardon for tha dead.
But on Sabellus' yet mom pitaoua death
Their eyes were fastened. Clinging to his skin
A Seps with curving tooth, of little aize, 000
He aeized and tore away, and to the sanda
Pieroed with his javelin. Small the serpent's bulir3
Nona deala a death more horrible in form.
For swist tha flesh diasolving round the vound

Bared the pale bone3 swam all hia limbs in blood ε
