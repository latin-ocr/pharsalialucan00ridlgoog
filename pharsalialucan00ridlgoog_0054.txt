ΒοοιΙ ΤΗΕ CROSSING OF THE RUBICON 23

Rushed down, end drawing fire in northern parts
Plunged on the summit of the Alban mount.

The stare thet run their courses in the void

0f night, eame forth at noontide, end the moon

Whose orb complete gave back her brother's ruys,

nid by the shade of earth, grew pole end wan.

The sun himself, when poised in mid career,

Shrouded his burning ear in bleckest gloom σου
And plunged the world in darkness, so thet men
Despoined of day-like es he veiled his light

¹ From thet fell bouquet which Myoenae saw.
The jaws of Etno were agape with fleme

That rose not heavenwards, but headlong fell

In smoking stream upon th' italien flank.

Then black Charybdis, from her boundloes depth,
Threw up o gory sea. In piteous tones

Howled the wild dogs3 the Vesta] iire was metohed
From off the alten end the fleme thet crowned olo
The Latin festival was split in iwerin,

As on the Theben pyre,² in ancient deys3

Barth tottered on its bose: the mighty Aips

From off their summits shook th' eterno] snow.³

In huge upheavel Ooean raised his woves

O'er Calpe's rock end Atlas' homy head.

The native gods shed tems, end holy swent
Dropped from the idols; gists in tempies fell:

Foul birds defiled the day ; beosts lest the woods

¹ Compare Ben Jonson’s ‘catiline,' 1. 1:-

Leooa. Thedeygoesbnok‚

01 else my nenses
Cunus. As et Atreus' feast.

¹ When the Theben brothers, Eteocles and Polynices, were being bnrned
on thesemo pyre the fleme ahot op in two seperate tongues, indioeting
ἒῖἰὶζοῗέθῖοςὼ they oould not be rooonoiled (Mt. Heskins’ note. citing

The hetin word is junia. ’
