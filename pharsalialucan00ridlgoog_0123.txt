PHARSALIA Boo: lv

All moisture gothered; here at lost, forbidden oo
To poss thot seo by Zephyr's bounds contained,
And by the furtheet belt¹ of heaven, they pense,

ln messes huge convolved; the widest brendth
Of murky air source holds thern, which divides

Earth from the heavens; till pressed by weight of sky
ln densest volume to the earth they pour
Their octennem no lightning could endum
Such storm unquenched : though oft ethwart the gloovn
Gleamed its pale fire. Meanwhile o watery erch
Smrce touched with colour, in imperfect shnpe oo
Embraced the shy ond drnnk the ocean waves,
So rendering to the clouds their flood outpouned.
And now the snows which Titan never yet
Could melt were thnwed: the Pyrenaean rocks
Are wet with flowing ioe; occustomed springs
Find not discharge ; ond from the very benks
Eech stream receives o tonent. Caeser's arms
Are shipwrecked on the field, his tottering camp
Swims on the rising flood; the trench is filled
With whirling waters3 and the plain no more roo
Yields corn or hine, for those who forage seek,
Err from the hidden furrow. Femine knocks
(First herold of o'erwhelming ills to come)
Fierce nt the door; ond while no foe blockodes
'Phe soldier hungers; fortunes buy not now
'lhe mennest mensure, yet, ales! is found
The festing pensant, who, in goin of gold,
Will sell his little all ! And now the hills
Are seen no more; rivers in one vest sea
