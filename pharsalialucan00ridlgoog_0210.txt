Boon VI THE WITCH OF THESSALIA 181

⁴ If 1 heve power the Stygien lehee ic show,
‘The bank that eounds with lire, the fury band,

‘ And giunta lethem, and the bound that cheles
‘ Bristling with headr of snakes his triple head,
‘Whetlecristhisthetcringecatthesight
‘ of timid chivering chades ?'
Then ic her prayer.
First through his gaping bosom blood she poure
still fervent, waching from his wounds the gore. wc
Then copiouc poisons from the moon distils
Mixed with all monstrous things which Nature's pange
Bring lc untimely birth; the froth from dcgs
Stricken with maduere, foeming ct the stream
A lynx's enh-aih: and the knct that grows
Upon the fell hyaene3 llesh cf stege
Fed upon serpents3 and the suching fish
Which holds the veceel beck ¹ though eastern winds
Male bend the cauves3 dragcn's eyes ; and sicnes
That sound benecth the brooding eagle's wings. ⁸0⁰
Nor Araby's viper, nor the ocean snake
th in the Red Sea wetere gucrds the ehell,
Are wanting; nor the slough cn Libyan sends
By horned reptile casn nor ashes fail
Snatched from an altar where the Phoenix died.
And viler poisons many, which herself
Hes made, she adds, wheoehr no neme is given:
Pestiferous leaves pregnant with magic chants
And bladee of grass which in their primcl grcwhh
Her cirrsed mouth had climed. Last came her voice διο
More potent than all herhs ho chaun the gods
, Who rule in Lethe. Dissonant murmure first
And sounds discordant from the tongues of men

¹ One ol the miraculouc ctcriec to be round in Pliny'c‘ Natural Hietcry!
