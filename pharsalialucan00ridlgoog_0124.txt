Boos lv CAESAR IN SPAIN 95

0f whirlpools overwhelmed; beusts borne away 110
And sucked beneeth the stream ; their rocky dens
Sweep onwurds ς and the tonent's raging foroe

Beers back the inflowing ocean. Nor does night
Aclrnowledge Phoebus' rise, for ull the sky

Feels her dominion and obscures its fuce,

And darkness joins with darkness. 'rbus doth lie

'l'he lowest earth beneeth the snowy zone

And never-ending winters, where the sky

Is sturless ever, und no growth of herb

Sprouts from the lrozen earth ; but standing ioe 12⁰
Tempers ¹ the stars which in the middle zone

Kindle their flames. Thus, Father of the world,
And thou, Ο trident-god who rul'st the ses
Second in place, Neptunus, loud the uir

With clouds oontinuul3 forbid the tide,

Once risen, to return : ioroed by thy weves

Let rivers beckwmd run in different course,

Thy shores no longer reaching: end the earth,

Sheken, malie wey for floods. let Rhine o'erssow
And Rhone their banks; let tor-rents spread ulield mo

Unmeasured waters: melt Rhipaean snows:
Spreed lakes upon thelonei, und sees profound,

And snutoh the groening world from civil war.
Thus lor a little moment Fortune tried

Her derling son; then smiling to his part
ltetumed3 and gained her purdon for the post
By greater gifts to come. For now the uir

Hud grown more clear, und Phoebus' warnier ruys

Coped with the llood and souttered ull the clouds

ln fleecy musses3 and the reddening eost 1⁴0
Proclaimed the coming day3 the lund resumed

¹ The ides is that- the oold ol the poles tempere the neat ol the aquator.
