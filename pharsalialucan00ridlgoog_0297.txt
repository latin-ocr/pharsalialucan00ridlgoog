‘ Rapt to the shades ,θ’ Thus he: but Sextus said 1⁶0
‘ Oh happy thou who by report alone

‘ Haar'st of the deed that chanoed on yonder shore!
‘ These eyes that saw, my brother, share the guilt.

‘ Not Coesar wrought his death, nor any chief

⁶ Worthy to cause the ruin of our sire.

‘ He fell by order of that shameful king
‘ Who rules o'er Nilus ; trusting to the gods
‘ Who shield the guast, and to his prinoely boon
‘ of yore—a victim for the realm he gave.
‘ 1 saw them pierre our noble father's breast3 roo
‘ Yet deeming not the petty Pharian prince
⁶ So fell a deed would dare, on Egypt's strand
‘ Ι thought great Caesar stood. But worse than all,
‘ Worse than the wounds which gaped upon his hamc
‘ Struck me with horror to the inmost heart,
‘ Our murdered father's head, shorn from the trunk
‘ And borne aloft on javelin; this sight,
‘ As rumour said, the cruel victor asked
‘ To feast his eyes, and prove the bloody deed.
‘ For whether rarenous birds and Pharian dogs 170
‘ Have torn his corse asunder‚ or a fire
‘ Consumed it, which with stealthy flama arose,
‘ 1 know not. For the fates' unjust decree
⁶ Which rest his limbs asunder, 1 forgive
⁶ The gods: 1 weep the part preserved by men?
Thus Sextus spake: but Cnaeus at the tale
Restrained the tear, and sorbis father's shanre
Flamed into sury : ‘Launch our navias forth,
‘ Ye sailors‚ from the shore, by stulwart arms
‘ Forced through the deep against opposing vinds: rao
‘ Captains, lead on: for civil strife ne'er gave
‘ So great a pn'ze3 to lay in earth thevlimbs ·,
‘ Of Magnus, and avenge him 'with th'e blood
