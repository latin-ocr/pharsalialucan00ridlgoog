‘ At Caessr's feet his standards. Me do ye think
‘ Such es yourselves‚ and slow to meet the futes?
‘ Your love sor Magnus and the Senete's cause
‘ Is less then mine for death? These were his words ς
And dust in oolumns proved thet Coesar cume.
Thus was Pompeius' glory spered the stein
of ssight compelled by Scaeve. He, when oeesed 290
The battle, fell, no more by rege ol light,
Or sight ol blood out-pouring from his wounds‚
Roused to the combat. Feinting there he lay
Upon the shouldeis of his comrades borne,
Who him udoriug (es though deity
Dwelt in his bosom) for his metohless deeds,
Plucked forth the gory shelts ond took his unns
To decl( the gods eud shield the breust of Mers.
Thrice happy thou with such a neme echieved,
Hsd but the heroe lberien from thy swerd, ³⁰0

The light Centobrien: now no spoils ol thine
Shell decl( the Thunderer's temple, nor upraise
The shout of triumph in the ways of Rome.
For all thy prowess, all thy ‹leeds of pride
Do but prepare her iord.
Nor on this hond
Repulsed‚ Pompeius idly oeased from war,
Content within his bars3 but es the see
Tioeless‚ which tempests force upon the cmg
Thet breaks it, or which gneus e mountain side διο
Some day to fall in ruin on itself ;
He sought the tunets nearest to the mein,
On double onset bent; nor closely kept
His troops in hund, but on the speoious plain
Spreed forth his camp. They joyful leave the tents
And wander et their will. Thus Padus flows
