162 PHARSALIA 3001 v1

Above the swords upraised, till in mid throng

Of foes he stood, hemmed in by densent ranke

And ramperted by wnr3 in front end rear,

Where'er he struck, the vietor. Now his eword
Blunted with goie nongenied no more could wormd, 22⁰
But breke the strichen limb; while every hand

F lung every quivering dart ethim elone;

Nor missed their eim, for rang against his shield

Dart ester dart unming, end his helm

In broken fragments prereed upon his br0w;

His vital parte were snfegunrded by spears

That bristled in his body. Fortune saw

Thus weged a novel combat, for there war-red

Against one man en army. Why with darts,

Mndmen, annail him and with slender ehrstn, 220

'Geinst which his life is proof ? Or ponderous stonee
This warrior chief shall overwhelm, or holte

Flung by the twisted thongs of mighty slings.
let steel-shod ram or catapult remove
This champion of the gnte. No fragile wall

Stnnds here for Coesan blocking with its bulk
Pompeius' wey to freedom. Now he truste

His shield no more, lest his sinister hand,

Idie, give life by shame3 end on his breest

Hearing a forest of spears, though spent with toil 2⁴⁰
And worn with onset, falls upon his foe

And breves alone the wounds of all the war.

Thus may an elephant in Afn'c wastes,

Oppressed by frequendum, break those that fall
Rebounding fmm his horny hide, end shake

Those that find lodgment, while his life within

Lien sese, protected‚ nor does speer avail

To rench the fount of blood. Unnumbered wounds
By arrow dealt, or lance, thus fail to siey
