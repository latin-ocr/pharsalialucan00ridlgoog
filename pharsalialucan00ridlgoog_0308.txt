Boot IX CATO

To bring from further limits of the world

Our banquet tables and the fruit they bear.¹

But suns exoessive and a scorehing clime

Burn all the glebe beside the shisting sanda:

There die the herrests on the crumbling mould; mo

No root finds sustenanoe, nor kindly Jove

Makes rich the furrow nor matures the vine.

Sleep binde all nature and the tract of send

Lies ever fruitless, save that by the oosst

The hardy Nasamon plucks a soanty mass.

Unclothed their raoe, and living on the wom

Worked by the cruel Syrtes on the world.

He dwells a spoiler by the sandy naves,

And while no ships unlade upon his shore,

Grows rich by wrecks-his only trade with man. oro
By such a path at hardy Cato's word

His soldiers passed in thought from winda secure

Nor dreading storms: but fearful was their lot

More than on ocean waves 3 for Auster's foroe

Here strikes with greater strength upon the sends,

And yet more freught with mischief : neither crags

Repelled his strength, nor losty mountains tamed

His furious onset, nor in sturdy woods

He found a bar3 but free from surb he raged

O'er the defenceless earth. Nor merely dust ⁶³⁰

Swirled np in drists of rain, but Earth herself,

ln major part, was rapt into the air

On ceeseless whirlwinds borne, until amared

The Nasamon saw his soenty field and home

Reft by the tempest, and the native huts

From roof to base were hmm'ed on the blant.

Not higher, when some alldevouring fleme

¹ Oitron tables were in much request at Rome. (comp. ‘Parodtse
negusar: Book lv.. 11⁵; and aea Book X. line 170.)
