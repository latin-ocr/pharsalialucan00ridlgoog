xvi munci: ΤΟ THE HRST EDITION

says in his introduction to the Cambridge edition, that a
Drydenisnequioed to giveusinEnglish enideo oi the strength
and vigour of the original poem. Iamfully conscious oi the
truth oi this, although Ι may be allowed to think that lien
Jonson’s poweriul blank werse might possibly have given us
a more adequaie rendering oi the teme and pointed style of
Lucan than even Dryden's heroics. But the fact remains that
there is no good English version of the work.

Msrlowe's translation oi Book 1. has dignity and force3
but the movement is slow, ond it vanu dash. The
Elimbethan poet seems to have thought it necessary to limit
the number oi his lines by those oi the originnh the result
is that some oi the idess ere not reproduoed. Among many
powerhd lines there are wealr ones, and he does not always
n'se to the level of the stronger passages. The famous line

Victrix causa Deis placuit, scd victa Catoni,
has not yet been well translated, and perhaps never will be;

but when Marlowe wrote
Cesar's cause

The gods obetted Cato liked the other,

he was hardly equal either to Lucan or himself. lquotc a
short passage as o sair specimen of the whole :

So theoder, which the wind tears from the clouds,
With ersek of risen air and hidooua sound,
Filling the world, leaps out and throws forth fire,
Affrights poor feariul men, and blasts their eyes
With overthwarting fimes, and raging shoots
Alongst the eir, and not resisting it
Falla and returns and shiverr where it lighta
Lines lor-1⁵7.

Thomas May's translation (published 1627) is in the
heroic mehe. lt contains passsges of some merit ς but it is
extremely unequal and is disfigurnd by diction frequently
ohsnrre, ond by o iashion oi rhyming which to modern·
