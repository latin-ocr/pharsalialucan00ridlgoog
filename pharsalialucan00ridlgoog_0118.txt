Yet did the memory of his prowess stir
I‘hoeoean youths to emulete his fame.
0st stumbling o'er the benches the old men haskes
To reech his bey, and h'nds him breathing still.
No tear bedewed his cheek; upon his breest
No blow he struck ; but all his heme was stin, ⁸1⁰
His hands oufspresd: and 0'er his eyes these fell
Α dark impenetrable vei] of mist
That blotted out the ἂψ nor could he more
Discern his lucldess Argus. He, who saw ’
His pavent, raising up his drooping head
With pel-ted lips and silent features asks
A father's latest kiss, e father's hand
To close his dying eyes. But soon his sire,
Recovering from his swoon, when ruthless grief
Possessed his spin‘t, ‘This short speee,' he eried, ⁸20

‘ But die before thee. Grant thy sorrowing sire
‘ F orgiveness that he fled thy last embrace.
‘ Not yet hes passed thy life blood from the wound
‘ Nor yet is death upon thee-still thou may'st¹

The reeking sword and dreve it to the hile,
T hen plunged into the deep, with hesdlong bound,
To anticipete his son : for this he feaoed
A single form of death should not suffice. sso
Now gave the fetes their judgment, and in doubt
No longer was the war: the Grecien fleet

In most pert sunl< 3—s0me ships by Romans oared
Conveyed the victore home: in hesdlong ssight
Some sought the yards for sheher. On the strand

What tems of parents for their offispring slain,
