Βοοι 11 THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS 33

‘ No more the Massagete: unoonquered Rhine
‘ Let loose from frutheat North her fair-haired tribes: eo
‘Elbe, pour thy Suevians forth! Let us be foas
¹ ‘ Of all the peoples. May the Getan prees
‘ Here, and the Dacian there3 Pompeius meet
‘The Eastern erchem, Coesar in the West
‘ Confront th' Iberian. Leave to Rome no hand
‘ To raise against herself in ciiil strife.
‘ Or, if Italia by the gods be doomed,
‘ Let all the sky, fieroe Parent, be dissolved
‘ And falling on the earth in flaming bolts,
‘ Their hands still bloodlass, strike both leaders down, 70
‘ With both their hosts! Why plunge in novel crime
‘ To settle which of them shall rule in Rome?
‘Soanoe were it worth the price of civil war
‘ To hinder either? Thus the patriot voice
Still found an utteranee, soon to speak no more.
Meantime, the aged fathers o'er their fetes
ln anguish grieved, detesting life prolonged
That brought with it another civil war.
And thus spake oue, to justify his fears:

‘ No other deeds the fates laid up in store 8⁰
‘ When Marius,l victor over Tanton hosts,

‘ Afrio's high conqueror, cast out from Rome,

‘Lay hid in marshy oone, at thy behest,

‘ O Fortune! by the yielding soil conoealed

‘ And waning rushes; but ere long the chains

‘ Of prison wore his weak and aged frama,

by the magistrates of Minturnae to the house of a woman named Fannia,
and thare looked apin a dark apanmena lt does not appear that he was
there long. Δ Gallio soldier was sant to kill him ‘and the eyes of Marius
appeared to him to dart a strong flama. and a lond voioe iamed from the
gloom. ⁴⁸ Man, do you dare to kill Galus uanus f ”¹ He ruahed out exolaim·
