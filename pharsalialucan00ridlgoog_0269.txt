240 PHARSALIA Βοοι vm

6 Wounds and disasters which are ours alone?

‘ Rome until now, though subject to the yoke

‘ Of civic despots, yet within her walls

6 Has brooked no foreign lord. And art thou pleased
‘ From all the world to summon to her gates

‘ These savage peoples‚ while the standsrds lost

‘ By lar Euphrates when the Crassi fell

‘ Shall leod thy columns? shall the only king 41⁰
‘ Who failed Emathia, while the fetes yet hid

‘ Their favouring voices, breve the victor's power,

‘ And join with thine his fortune? Nay, not so

‘ This nation trusts itself. Each racc that clainrs

‘ Α northern birth, unconquered in the fray

‘ Claims but the warrior's death ς butas the sky
6 Slopes towards the eastern tracts and gentler elimes

‘ So are the natione. There in flowing robes
‘ And garments delicate are men arrayed.
‘ True that the Parthian in Sarmatia's plains‚ 420
‘ Where Tigris spreads across the level meads,
‘ Contende invincible3 for ssight is his
6 Unbounded; but should uplands bar his path
‘ He scales them not; nor through the night os war
‘ Shall his weak bow uncertain in its aim
‘ Repel the foemam nor his strength of arm
‘The torrent stem ; nor all a summer's day
6 In dust and blood bear up against the foe.
6 They fill no hostile trench‚ nor in their hands
‘ Shall battering engine or machine of war 430
6 Dash down the rampart3 and whate'er avails
‘ To stop their arrone, battles like a wall.¹
‘ Wide sweep their horsemen‚ fleeting iu attach
‘ And light in onset, and their troops shall yield
6 Α camp, not take it: poisoned are their shafts;
¹ Thes is, can be as easily defended.
