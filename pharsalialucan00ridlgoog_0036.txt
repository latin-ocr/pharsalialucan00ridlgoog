Add‚ Caeser, ὼ these illo the Mutin toils3

All heeven rejoieing; end shalt hold e throne,
Or else elect io govern Phoebus' oar
And light e subject world that shall not dread
To owe her brightness to e different Sun ς
All shall conoede thy right: do what thou wilt,

Whenoe thou sholt rule ὼε world with power divine. oo
And yet the Norihern or the Seuthem Pole
We pray thee, ohoose noi3 bui in reys direct
Vouoheafe thy radience to ὼγ city Rome.
Press thou on either eide, the universe
Should lose its equipoise: take thou the midst,
And veight the scales, end let that pert of heaven
Where Caeser sits be evermore serene
And smile upon us with unclouded blue.
Then may all men ley down their arms, end peooe
Through all the natione reign, end shut the gates 70
Thet close the temple of the God os War.
Be thou my help, to me e'en now divine!
Let Delphi's sieep her own Apollo gund,
And Nysa keep her Bocchus, uninvoked.
Rome is my subject end my muse ert thou !
First oi such deedr 1 purpose to unfold

The causes-besl( immense-what drove to arms Α

Α moddened netion and hom all the world ,
Shock peeoe away.
