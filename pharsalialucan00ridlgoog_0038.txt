Like to the slender neck thot reparatos

Who held oport the chiefs, in piteous death,

'⁸ More iu that victory than ye thought was won,
Ye sons oi Arsaces ; your conquered foen
Took ot your hands the roge os civil atrise.
By sword the realm is purted3 ond the stote
Supreme o'er earth ond sea, wide es the world,
Could not find spooe for two.² For J ulio bore,
Cut off by fote unpitying‚³ the bond
Of thot ill-omened marriagesand the pledge
Of blood united, to the shades below.
Hadet thou but longer stayed, it had been thino loo
To keep the parent end the spouse apori,
Strike sword from gresp and join the threatening hands;

As Sabine matrone in the days os old
J oined in the midst the bridegroom ond the sire.
With thee all trust was huried, und the chiefs

Could give their couruge vent, ond nuhed to war.
