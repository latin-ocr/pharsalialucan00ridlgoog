Βοοι v¹ THE FAREWELL 151

‘Our armies rout, still let my choicest part
‘ Survive in thee; il sated is my flight, , sio
‘ Still leave me that whereto 1 lain would fiee?
Hardly at first her sensas grasped the woids
ln their full misery3 then her mind amazed
Could scaroe find uttemnce lon the grief that pressod.
‘ Nought‚ Magnus, now is leit wherewith to upbraid
‘The gods and latas ol marriage ; 'tis not death
‘That parts our love, nor yet the funensd pyoe,
‘ Nor that doead toroh which marks the end ol nll.
‘ l share the ignohle lot of vulgar lives:
‘ My sponse rejects me. Yes, the loeis come! sao
‘ Break we our bonds and J ulia's sioe appease !-
‘ ls this thy consort, Magnus, this thy saith
‘ ln her fond loving heart? Can danger hight
‘ Her and not thee? Long since our mutual fatos
‘ Hang by one chain; and dost thou bid me now
‘ The thunder·bolts ol ruin to withstand
‘ Without thee? Is it well that 1 should die
‘ Even while you pray for fortune? And suppose
‘ 1 llee from evil and with death sels-sought
‘ Follow thy footsteps to the realms below— sivo
‘ Ani l to live till to that distant isle
‘ Some taidy rumour of thy sall may come?
‘And then thou say'st, unfeeling! that by uso
‘ Strength shall be mine to bear such load of ills
⁶ As late reserves forus ι but at such a strength
‘ hly spirit trembles. Ah! forgive the truth.
‘ And is the favouring gods shall hear my praye1s‚

‘ 1 shall be last to hear the victory

‘ ln that lone isle of rocks. When all are glad,

⁶ My heart shall throb with anguish, and the sail ooo
‘ Which brings the message 1 shall see with sear,

‘ Not safe e'en then: for Caesar in his ssight

‘ hlight seize nne there, abandoned and alone
