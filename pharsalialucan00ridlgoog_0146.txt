Boon lv DEATH OF CURIO 117

Driving the hostile host with sword and spent,

Hc smoic them till their camp opposed his way.

But aiter Varus' roub, unseen till then,
Alleageriortheglorytobehis,

By stcslth came Juba: silent was his march; ero
His only iear lest rumour should forestall

His coming victory. In pretended wer

He sends Sabura forth with scanty force

To bsmpt the enemy, while in hollow vale

He holds the armies of his malm unscen.

'Tis thus the sly ichneumon¹ with his tail

waning, allutea the serpent of the Nile

Drawn to the mowing shsdow: he, with head

'lhuned sideways‚ welches till the wichim glidcs

Within his resch, then scices by the throni seo
Behind the deadly fangs: forth from its seat

Ballrcd oi iis purpose, through the brimming jaus

Gushcs a tide oi poison. Fortuna smiled
On J uba's stratagem for Curio
(The hiddcn forces oi the foe unknown)

Sent forth his horse by night without the camp

To soour more distant regions. He himself

m aarum pap oi dawn na arry forn

His standarum hesding not his captains’ prayer

Urged on his cars: ‘Beware of Punic fraud, eso
⁴ The crast that {ainis a Carthaginien wau?¹

Hung over him the doom of coming death

And gave ihc youth to fabe3 and civil strife

Dregged down its author.
On the losty tops

small one. ‘Its first emotion seemed to be astonishment mixed with
angen ite hair became ereot; in an instant it slipped behind the reptile,
and with remarkable ewiftness and agility leaped upon its head, seissd it
and orushed it with its tseth!
