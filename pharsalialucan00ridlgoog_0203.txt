PHARSALIA 3001 m

Uphill ς the summer hest no longer swells

Nile in his oourse3 Moeander's stream is stmight3

Slow Rhone is quickeoed by the rush of Saone ;

Hills dip their heudo and topple to the plain3

Olympus sees his clouds drift overhuud3

And sunless Scythia's sempimrnal snows

Melt in mid-winton the inflowing tides 570
Driven onward by the moon, at that dread chnut

Ebb from their course; surth's oxos, else unmovod‚
Have trembled‚ and the force oeutripetul

Hos tottam, and the earth's compactod frome

Struck by their voioe hos goped‚ till through the void
Men saw the moving sky.¹ All beasts most fleme

And savuge sear them, yet with deudly aid

quish the witobos' urbs. Tigers auurst

For blood, and noble lions, oo them fawn

With blond curasses ε serpeots at their woml sm

Uncoil their cisoles, and extendod glide
Along the surfooe of the fiosty field ς

The viper's seveoed body joins auew3
And dios the snake by human venom sloin.

Whenee comes this lobour on the gods, compellod
To hearken to the magio chant and spdls,
Nor dan'ng to despiso them ? Doth some bond

Control the deitios? Is their pleosuoe so,

Or must they liston? and have silent threuts

Prevoiled, or piety unseen moeived oso
So goeat a guemion? Against all the gods

Is this their iustumne, or on one alone

Who to his will coustrains the universe,

Himself constrained? Stars most in yonder olime
Shoot beadlong from the zenith; and the moon

¹ Tho sky was supposed to move round, but to be restninsd in its
ooutso by the planeto. (See Book X, lino 238.)
