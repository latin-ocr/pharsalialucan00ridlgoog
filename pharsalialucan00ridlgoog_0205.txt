PHARSALIA Boon vl

The gods at her first utteranoe grant her prayer

For things uniawfuh lest they hear again

Its fearful oooents: men whose limbo were quick

With vital power she thrust within the grave

Decpiie the fares who owed them years to come: ooo

The funeral reversed brought from the tomb

Those who were dead no longer3 and the pyre

Drags from their cavities, ond mauis the nnil

Upon the withered hand: she gnows the noose

Wrenches the iron‚ and from the unbending bond

Hangs by her teeth‚ ond with her hands collecto

The slimy goie which drips upon the limbo.

Where lay a corpse upon the noked earth oro

On ravening birds ond beosts of prey the hag

Kept which, nor maned by knife or hand her spoil‚

Till on his wictim seized some nighfly woli ς ¹

Then dragged the morsel from his thirsty fangs3

Need blood fresh issued from the geping throni,
