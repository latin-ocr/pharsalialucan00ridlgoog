, 156 PHARSALIA Boou Vl

Watch o’er the fortress of Corinthiun birth ao
Which by its towers alone without a guard

Was saie against a siege. No hand of man

In ancient days built up her lofty wall,

No hammer rang upon her massire stones:

Not all the works of war, nor Time himself

Shall undermine her. Nature's hand has raised

Her adamantine rocks and hedged her in

With bulwarks girded by the foamy main:

And but for one short bridge of narrow earth

Dyrrhachium were an island. Steep and fiercc, ³0

Dreuded of sailors‚ are the cliffs that bear

Her walls; and tempests, howling from the south,

Toss up the soaming main upon the roofs;

And homes and temples tremble at the shock.
Thirsting for battle and with hopes inflamed

Here Caesar hostes, with distant rampart lines

Seeking unseen to coop his soe within,

Though spread in spacious camp upon the hills.

With eagle eye he mensures ont the land

Meet to be compassed nor content with turs 4ο

Fit fora hasty mound, he bids his troops

Tear from the qnam'es many a giant rock :

And spoils the dwellings of the Greeks, and dmgs

Their walls asunder for his own. Thus rosc

A mighty banier which no ram could burst

Nor any ponderous machine of war.

Mountains are clest, aud level through the hills

‘Ine work of Caesar strides: wide yawns the mont,

Forts show their towers rising on the heights‚

And in vast circle forests are enclosed so

And groves and spacious lamis, and beasts oi' prcy‚
As in a line of toils. Pompeius lacked
Nor field nor foroge in th' cncircled span
