6 While yet I breathe, nnseemly. O'er my tomb

⁶ Weep ont thy full, the final pledge of saith.
‘ Thou hast no loss, nor has the war destroyed
6 Anght save my fortune. 1f sor that thy grief,
6 That uas thy love'
Roused by her husband's words,

Yet scarcely could she raise her trembling limbs,
Thus speaking through her sobs: 6 Would Ι had songht
6 Detested Caesar's conch, ill-omened wife

6 0f sponse unhappy3 at my nuptisls twice 1⁰0
6 Α Fury has been bridesmaid; and the ghosts

6 Of slanghtered Crassi, with avenging shades

6 Brought by my wedlock to thy doomed camp

6 Α Parthian massacm. Twioe my star bas cursed
‘The world, and peoples have been hurled to death

‘ In one red moment; and the gods through me

6 Have left the better cause. Ο, hero mine,

6 0 mightiest husband, wedded to a nise

6 Unworthy! Twas through her that Fortune gained
‘The right to strike thee. Wherefore did 1 wed 11⁰
6 To bring thee misery? Mine, mine the guilt‚

6 Mine be the penalty. And that the wave

6 May bear thee gently onwards, end the kings

6 May keep their saith to thee, and all the earth

6 Be ready to thy rule, me from thy side

‘ Cast to the billows. Rather had Ι died

6 To bring thee victory: thy disasters thus,

6 Thus expiate. And, cruel J ulia, thee,

6 W ho by this war hest vengeance on our rous,

6 From thine abode 1 call: atonement find 12⁰
6 111 this thy rival's death, and spere at least

‘ Thy Magnus? Then upon his breest she fell,

While all the conoourse wept-e'en Magnus' seli,
Who saw Tbessalia's field without a tear.
