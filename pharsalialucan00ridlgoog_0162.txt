Booxv THE MUTINY 133

His high behest drew natione to the ναις
Now, meimed of all who smote, no neapon lest
Seving his own, he knows thet swords unsheathed
Are wielded by the soldier, not the chief.
No timorous voioe was there ; no silent wrath
Conceeled; nor doubting mind, es though alone
Indignont et the wrong, and in distrrut eoo
Of those in turn distrusting. Feer in each
Hed fied before the boldness of the host:
The crime is free where thousands beer the guilt.
They hurled their menece: ‘Caeser‚ give us leave
‘To quit thy crimes; thou seek'st by lond end see
‘The sword to sley us; let the fields of Gaul
‘And far Iberi& end the world proclaim
‘ How for thy victories our oomrades fell.
‘What boou itus thet by en ermy's blood
‘The Rhine and Rhone and oi] the northern lends :uo
‘Thou huot subdued? Thou giv'st us civil war
‘For ull these bettles; such the prize. When fied
‘The Senete trembling, end when Rome was ours
‘What homes or temples did we epoil? Our hands
‘Reek with offenoe ! Aye‚ but our poverty
‘Procleimo our innooence! What end shall be
‘Of arms and armico? What shell be enough
‘Is Rome suffice not? ond what lies beyond?
‘Behold these silvered looks, these nerveless hands
‘And shmnken arms, once stalwurt! In thy wars ³20
‘Gone is the strength of life, gone all its pride!
‘Diemiss thine eged soldiers to their deoths.

‘How shameless is our prayer! Not on hard turf
‘To stretch our dying limbs; nor seek in vein,
‘When parts the soul, a hand to close our eyes ;

‘ lNot with the hehn to strike the stony ground:

¹ Reuding ‘gulam' with Francken ; not ‘glebm’
