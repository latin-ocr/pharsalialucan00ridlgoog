· PHARSALIA soor rx

Thus was their stubborn patience of its plaints
Disburdened. But the bravery of their chief
Foroed them to bear their toils. Upon the sand, ,
All bere, he lies and dares at every hour
Fortune to strike: he only at the fate
0f each was present, ssew to every oall; 1040
And roused their hearts to fight the poison germ.
Not lile he brings them, but the strength in death
To die without a groan-to groan were shame
When he was witness—over him what power
Had plegue or venom? In a oomrode's breast
They see him conquer anguish; and they leam,
Gazing on him, how weak the power of pain.

Some aid from Fortune, weary of their woes,

At length they gained. Ol all who till the earth
The Psyllians only are by snakes unharmed. 105⁰
Potent as herbs their song3 safe is their blood,

Nor gives admission to the poison germ

E'en when the chent hes oeased. Their home itself
Plaoed in such venomous tract and serpent-thronged
Gained them this vantage‚ and a tnroe with death,
Else could they not have lived. Such is their trust
in purity of blood, that newly born

Each habe they prove by test of deadly esp

For foreign lineage. So the bird of Jove

Turns his new fledglings to the rising sun loeo
And such as gaze upon the beams of day

With eyes unwavering, for the use ol heaven

He rears; but such as blink at Phoebus' rays

Casts from the nest. Thus of unmixed desoent
The babe who, dreading not the serpent touch,
Plays in his cradle with the deadly snake.

Nor with their own immunity from harm

Contented do they rest, but watoh for gnrests

Who need their help against the noisome plague.
