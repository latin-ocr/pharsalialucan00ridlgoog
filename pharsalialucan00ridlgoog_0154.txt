Booxv THE ORACLE 125

‘ Fails with the dying year: not so does yours;

They heard his words, and placed their country's fetes,
Nor less their own, within the chiestein's hands.

Honours well earned—Rhodes, Mistress of the Seas,
Was decked with gists3 Athena, old in fame, so
Reoeived her praise‚ and the rude tribes who dwell
On cold Taygetus ς Massilie’s sons
Their own Phocaea's freedom; on the chiefs
of Thracian tribes, fit honours were bestowed.

To serve King J uba's sceptre3 and, elas!

On Ptolemoeus‚ oi e faithless race

The faithless sovereign‚ standal to the gods,

And sheme to For-tune, placed the diadem

Of Pella Boy! against the common henl 7⁰

Devised their counsel‚ Appius¹ only feared

To iace the chanoes of the war, and sought

Through Phoebus' ancient oracle to break

The silence of the gods, and know the end. so
