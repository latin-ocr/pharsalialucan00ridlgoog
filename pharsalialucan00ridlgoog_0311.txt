PHARSALIA 1³00: rx

Though rich Arabiane, lnd and Ethiop

Know him alone as Jove, still he is poor

Holding his shrine by richeo undehled

Through time ; and pure aa gods of olden days

He opums the weolth of Rome.¹ That here some god
Dwells, witnesses the only grove

That buda in Libya-for that which grows

Upon the arid dust which Leptis parts

From Berenice, knows no leaves; alone ero
Hammon uprears a wood; a fount the cause

Which with its wetere binde the crumbling soil.

Yet shall the Sun when poised upon the height
Strike through the foliage: hardly can the trec
Prohect ita trunk, and to a little space

His rays draw in the circle oi the chade.

Here have men found the spot where that high band
Solstitial divides in middle sky¹

The zodiec stare : not here oblique their course,

Nor Scorpion rises straighter than the Bull, oro
Nor to the Scules does Ram give back his hours,

Nor does Astraea bid the F ishes sink

More slowly down: but iratery Capricom

Is equal with the Crab, and with the Twins

The Archer; neither does the Lion rise

Above Aquarius. But the rece that dwells

Bryond the ferwour of the Libyan lires

Seea to the South that shadow which with us

Falla to the North : slow Cynosura sinlrs²

For them below the deep; and, ὼγ with us, 630
The Wagon plungcs3 iar from either pole,

No alar they know that does not seek the main,

¹ la.. where the equinoctial circle cute the aodiac in ita uentre.-
