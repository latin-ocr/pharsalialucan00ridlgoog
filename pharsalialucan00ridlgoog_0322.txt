roo-11< CATO 293

His oorselet holds not. Not in oaldron so

Boils up to mountainous height the steaming vave3 ooo
Nor in such bellying curves does oanvas bend
To Baetem tempests. Now the ponderous bulk
Rejects the limbs, and as a ohapeloss trunk
Burdens the earth: and there, ho δεαεῒε and birds
A fatal feast, his comrades leave the corse;
Nor dore to plooe, yet swelling, in the tomb.

But for their eyes the Libyan peste prepared
More dreodful sights. On Tullus great in beart,
And bound to Cato with admiring soul,
A fieroe Haemorrhois fixed. From every limb,¹ voo
(Ar from a statue saffron spray ie showered
In every part) there spoutod forth for blood
A sable poison: from the natura] pores
of moisture, gore profuse; his mouth vas filled
And gaping nostrils, and his teoto were blood.
Brimmed full his veins; his very svoot was κάς
ΑΗ vas one wound.

Then piteous Levus next

In sleep was victim, for around his heart
Stood still the blood oongmled: no pain he felt
of venomous booth, but vvist upon him fell ooo
Death‚ and he sought the shodes; more swist ho kill
No drought in poisonous oups from ripened planto
Of direst growth Saboean wirards brev.

Lo! Upon branohless trunk a serpent, nomed
By Libyans J oculus, rose in coils ho dart
His venom from afar. Through Paullus' brein
1t mohed, nor stayed3 sor in the vound itself

Wos death. Theo did they know how slovvly flios,
Flung from a sling, the stone3 how gently speed
Through air the shasts of Scythia.
