run oenone-ren nourr-ren oronu

Tuus hod the smiles of Fortune and her frowns
Brought either chief to Macedonian shores
Stil] equo] to his foe. From cooler skies
Sanlr Atlon'¹ daughters down, and Hoemus' slopes
Were while with winter, and the day drew nigh
Devoted to the god who leads the months,
And marking with new nomes the book of Rome,
When came the Pothers from their distant posts
By both the Consuls to Epirus called¹
Ere yet their year was deod: a foreign land ιο
Obscure received the magistrates of Rome;
A senate sojourning in foreign lands
Held there high questions, not in werlike camp
But hedged by ull the axes of the lew3
And all men garing on the reverend ranks
Knew that no Magnus' party there was met,
But all the stote; and Magnus was but oue.
Mid silent sodness from his losty seat
Thus spake the Consul: ‘If your hearts still beel
⁶ With Lation blood, and if within your breusts 20
‘ still lives your lethers' vigour, look not now
‘ On this strange land that holds us, nor enquire
‘ How far the captmed city. Know the foce
‘ Ol your own company ς the rulers you
‘ ln ull that comes. Be this your first deoree,
¹ The Pleiades, naid to be daughters of Aulus.

² There wore the Consule for the expinng year, nc. lu-caius Marcellus
and 1.. Lentulus crus.
