PHARSALIA a001v1

So rushing on their fate. Thus had the war
Shed its laet drop of blood and peace ensued‚
But Magnus suffered not, and held his troops eto
Beck from the battle.
'lhou‚ Ο Rome, hadet been

Free‚ happy, mistress of thy laws and rights
Were Sulla here. Now shalt thou ever grieve
'lhat in his monning crime, to have met in fight
A pious kinsman‚ Caesar's vantage lay.
Oh tragic destiny! Nor Munda's fight
Hispania had wept, nor Libya mourned
Enerimsoned Utica, nor Nilus' stream,
With blood unspeakable polluted‚ borne
A nobler corsa than her Egyptian kings: eoo
Nor J uba¹ lain unburied on the sends,
Nor Scipio with his blood outpoured appeased
The ghosts of Carthage; this had been thy last
Disester‚ Rome; nor had the blameless life
of Cato ended: and Pharsalia's name
Had so been blotted from the book of sate.

But Caesar lest the region where his arms
Had found the deities adverse, and marched
Hie ehatteoed columns to 'lhessalian lands.

Then to Pompeius oame (whose mind was bent ato
'l'o follow Caeear wheresoe'er he fied)
His oaptains‚ striving to persuade their chief
To seek Ausonia, his native land,
Now freed from ioes. ‘Ne'er will l pass‚' he said,
‘ My oounlry'e limit, nor revisit Rome
‘ Like Caesar, at the head of banded hosts.²

¹ ana and Petreius killed each other after the battle of Thapaua, to
avoid falling into Oaesars hands. See Book IV.. line 5.

’So cicero: ‘eheu 1, who hare been called saviour ol the oity and
father ot my country, bring into it an army of Geta Armeniam aod
Colohlanst' (¹ ΕΡ. ad Atticam: ix„ 10.)
