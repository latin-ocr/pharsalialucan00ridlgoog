Boo! 111 MASSIHA

Low down the Pole star, and Bootes runs

Hasting ho set, pari seen, his nightly course 3

And Eihiopians from urat southern land

Which lies without the circuit of the staro,

Did not the Bull with curving hoof advanced
O'eratep the limit. From that mountain zone
They caure, where rising from a common fount ooo
Euphrates flows and Tigris, and did earth

Permih wem joined with either name; but now
While like th' Egyptian flood Euphraias spruads
His fertilising water, Tigris first

Drawn down by earth irr covered depths is plunged
And holds a secret course3 then born again

Flows on unhinderud to the Persian sea.

But warlike Parthia wavemd 'twixt the chiefs,
Contcni to have made them two ¹ ; while Scythia's hordeo
Dipped frah their dario in poison, whom the stream διο

Of Bactros bounds and vast Hyrcanian woods.
Hence springs that ruggod nation swist and fierce,
Descendod from the Twins' great charioheer.²

Nor failed Sarmatia, nor the tribes that dwell

By richesi Phasis, and on Halys' banks,

Which scaled the doom of Croesus king; nor where
From far Rhipoean ranges Tanais flows,

On either hand a quarior of ihc world,

Asia and Europe, and in winding course

Carves outa continent; nor wheoe ihc struit 22⁰
Irr boiling surge pours to the Pontic deep

Maeotis' uatem, rivalling the pride

Of those Herculean pillargaics that guard

The entrance to an ocean. Thence with hair
