soon v11 THE BAmE 197

All heaven opposed their march: portentous fire
ln oolumns filled the plain, and iorehes blazed: 18⁰
And thimty whirlwinds mixed with metaor bolts
Smote on them as they strode, whose sulphurous flames
Perplexed the vision. Crests were struck from helms;
The melted sword-blade flowed upon the hilt:
The spear ran liquid, and the hurtfd sbeel
Smoked with a sulphur that had come from heaven.
Nay‚ more, the standands, hid by swarms of bees
Innumerable‚ weighed the bearet down,
Soame listed from the earth3 bedewed with tears3
No more of Rome the standards‚¹ or her state. 1⁹0
And from the altar fled the frantie bull
To fields efar3 nor was a victim found
Το grace the sacrifice of coming doom.

But thou, 0 cesar, to what gods of ill
Didst thou appeaJ? What fusiss didst thou eall,
What powers of madnees and what Stygian Kings
Whelmed in th* abyss of hell? Didst favour gain
By sacrifice in this thine impious war?
Strange sights were seen; or caused by hands divine
Or due to fearful fancy. Hoemus' top 200
Plunged headlong in the valley‚ Pindus met
With high Olympus, while at Ossa's feet
Red ran Boebeis,² and Pharsalia's field
Gave warlike voices as in depth of night.
Now darkness came upon their wondering gaze,
Now daylight pale and wan, their helmets wreathed
In pallid mist3 the spirits of their sires
Hovered in air, and shades of kindred dead
Passed flitting through the gloom. Yet had the host,

¹ uenoesonh to be the standands of the Emperor.
¹ A lake at the foot of Monnt Ossa Pindus, om, Olympus. and, above
all, Hamus (the Baikans) were at a long dismoe from Pharsalia Oomp.
