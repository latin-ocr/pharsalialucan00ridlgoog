PHARSALIA Boor V

Baffled‚ while yet the Empire of the world
Hung in the balance, sought his promised realm
In Chalcis of Euboea. Yet to esoape
All ills of earth, the erash of war-what god
Cen give thee such a boon, but death alone?
For on the solitary shore a grave
Awaits thee, where Carystos' marble crags¹
Draw in the passage of thesea, and where 270
The inne of Rhamnus rises to the gods¹
Who hate the proud‚ and where the ooean struit
Boils in swift whirlpools‚ and Euripus draws
Deaeitful in his tides a bane to ships,
Chalcidiau vessels to bleak Aulis' shore.

But Caesar oarried from the nonquered west
His eagles to another world of war3
When envying his victorious course the gods
Almost turned beck the prosperous tide of fate.

Not on the battle-field borne down by arms, 280
But in his tenta, within the rampart lines,

The hoped-for priae of this unholy war

Seemed for a moment gone. That faithful host,

His oommdes trusted in a hundred fields,

Almost forsook him. The sad trump perchance

Mute for a moment, and the blade in sheath

Grown sold, had tamed their fienzy for the war 3

Or else in hope of greater gitta, their cause

And leadar they betrayed, and sold the sword

Still soiled with murder. By no other risk aaa
Cesar more surely learned how as he looked

O'er all things else, the height on which he stood
Trembled beneeth him. But a moment since

¹ Appius was seized with fever aa soon es he maohed tha spot; aud
there he died eud wes buried, thus iultllliug the oraala.
² That is, Nemesis.
