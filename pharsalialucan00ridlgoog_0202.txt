Βοοι vl THE WITCH OF THESSALIA 173

Of those dread tones unspeakable has reached
⁴ The constellatione, then nor Babylon
Nor secret Memphis, though they open wide

The shrines of ancient magic and entreat
The gods, oould draw them from the fires that smoke

Upon the altars of far Thessaly. 54⁰
Το hearts oi flint those incantatione bring

Love, strange, unnatural; the old man's breast

Burns with illicit fire. Nor lies the power

ln harmful cup nor in the juicy pledge

Ol love maternal from the fooehead drawn 3¹

Charmed forth by spells alone the mind decays‚

By poisonous drugs unharmed. With woven threads Ι
Crossed in mysterious fashion do they bind

Those whom no passion born of benuteous form

Or loving oouch unites. All things on earth 55⁰
Change at their hidding; night usurps the day3

The heavens disobey their wonted laws;

At that dread hymn the Universe stands still 3

And Jove while urging the revoleing wheels

Wonders they move not. Toments are outpoured
Beneath a huming sun ς ond thunder roars

Unoaused by Jupiter. From their flowing locks
Vapours immense shall issue at their oall ς

When falls the tempest scas shall rise end foam¹
llloved by their spell; though powerless the breeze 500
Το mise the billows. Ships against the wind

With bellying sails move onward. From the rock
Hangs motionless the torrent: rivers run

¹ lt was supposed that there was on the forehead of the new-born foal
an excrescenoe‚ which was bitten off and eaten hythe mother. u she did
not do this she had no affecnon for tho toal. (virgil, ‘Eneid' lv.. 515.)
¹ ‘When the boisterous see,

without a brenth ol wind, heth lmoohed the sky.¹
