28 PHARSALIA BooxI

The frightened people heard, and as they heard

His words prophetie made them seor the mone.

But worse remained3 for ss on Pindus' slopes

Possessed with fury from the Thebon god 75⁰

Speeds some Baoehante, thus in Roman streets

Behold e metron run, who, in her tranoe,

Relieves her bosom of the god within.

‘Where dost thou snetch me, Paenn‚ to what shore

‘Thmugh airy regions borne? 1 see the snows

‘Of Thracian mountains3 end Philippi's pleins
‘Lie broad benenth. But why these battle lines,
‘No foe to vanquish-Rome on either hand?
‘Again 1 wonder 'neoth the rosy hues
‘Thnt paint thine eastern siries, where regal Nile rso
‘Meets with his flowing ware the rising tide.
‘Known to mine eyes that mutileted trunk
‘That lies upon the send ! Armes theseos
‘By changing whirlpools to the buming elimes
‘Of Libye borne, again 1 see the hosts
‘From Thracia brought by fate's command. And now
‘Thou benr'st me o'er the cloud-oompelling Alps
‘And Pyreneon summits; next to Rome.
‘There in mid-Senate see the closing soene
‘Ol' this foul war in foulest murder done. 77⁰
‘Again the sections rise; through all the world
‘ Onoe more 1 pass3 but give me some new land,
‘Some other region, Phoebus, to behold
‘Wsshed by the Pontio billows! for these eyes

‘Alrendy onoe heve seen Philippi's ploins Ξ '¹

The frenzy left her end she speechless fell.

¹ The oontnsion between the site ol the battle ot Philippi ond that of
tho battle ol Pharsalia is oommon among the Roman writers. (See the
notetoMerlrale, chapter xxvi) '
