Plungad in her vitale her victorious sword;

Armies akin embattlad, with the loroe

Ol all the shaken earth bent on the fray;

And burst asunder, to the common guill,

Why wago oampaigns that send no laureis home?

Or where laen frost that never yields to spring
In icy letters binde the Scythian main: 20
