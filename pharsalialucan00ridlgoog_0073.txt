PHARSALIA Boos 11

ς811011 unknown nations, touched by western strife,
‘And monamhs born beneath another olime

‘ Breve the dividing seas to join the war?

‘Shall Scythian tribes desert their distant north,
‘And Getae hastato view the fall of Rome,

‘And 1 look idly on? As some fond sire,

‘Reft of his sons, compelled by grief, himself
6Μ10011010 1110 long prooession 10 the lomb,

‘'Ilmrsts his own hand within the funeral flames,
‘Soothinghisheart and, as the lofty pyre 010
‘Risus on high, applies the kindled torch:

‘Nought Rome, shall tear thee from me, till 1 hold
‘Thy form in death embraoed; and Freedom's name,
‘Shade though it be, I‘ll follow to the grave.

‘Rome's expiation : 01 00 drop 01 blood

‘ The war be robbed. 1 would that, to the gods

‘Of heaven and hell devoted, this my lile

‘Might satisfy their vengeanoe. Decius fell,

‘Crushed by the hostile ranks. When Cato falls 000
‘Iet Rhine's fieroe barberous hordes and both the hosts

‘Thrust through my 101010 their darts! May 1 alone
‘Receive in death the wounds of all the war!

‘Thus may the people be mdeemed, and thus

‘ Rome for her guilt pay the 0100010001 due.

‘Why should men die who wish to bear the yoke
‘And shrink not from the tyranny 10 corne?

‘Strike me, and me alone, 01 laws and rights

‘In vain the guardian: this vioarious life

‘Shall give Hesperia peaoe and end her toils. 000
‘Who then will reign shall find no need for war.
‘You ask, Why follow Magnus? 11 he wins'
