Boon vm DEATH OF POMPEIUS 247

The crime's accompliehment. Proud ia the boy king
01 such unwonted honour, thathie slaves 111
So soon give power 111 eo great a deed.

They choose Achillae 111 the work of death 3
And where the treacheroua shore in Casian sande
Runa out, and shallow watera 11 thesea
Attest the Syrtes near, in little boat

He and hia partnera in the monstroua crime

With swords embark. Ye gods! and shall the Nile

And barbarous Memphis and th' effeminate crew

That thronga Pelusian Canopus raiae

Its thoughts to euch an enterprise? Do thus 111

Our 11111 prees on the world? Ι1 Rome thus fallen

That in our civil fraya the Pharian aword

Finds place, or Egypt? Ο, may civil war

Be thus far faithful that the hand which atrikee

Be 11 our hindred; and the foreign flend

Held worlde apart! Pompeius, great in aoul,

Noble in spirit, had deserved 1 death

From Caeaar's 1111. And, king, host thou 1111111

At such a ruin 11 so great 1 name?

And dost thou dare when heaven'e high thunder 11111, 141

Thou, puny boy, to mingle with its tonee

Thine impure utteranoe? Had he not won

A world by arma, and thrice in triumph scaled

The sacred Capitol, and vanquished kinga,

And championed the Roman Senate's cause3

He, kinsman 11 the victor? 'Tuas enough

To cause forbearance in 1 Pharian king,

That he was Roman. Wherefore with thy eword

Dost stab our breosts? Thou know'st not, impious
boy,

How stand thy fortunes; now no mom by right 111

Hast thou the sceptre of the land of Nile;
