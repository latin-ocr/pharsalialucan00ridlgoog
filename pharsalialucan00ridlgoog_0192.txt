Boot v1 SCAEVA'S EXPLOITS 168

This single warrior. But lo! from far 250
Α Cretan areher's shalt, more sure of aim

Than vove could hope for, strikes on Seoeva's hrow

To light within hia eye: the hero tugs

Intrepid‚ burata the nerves, and team the ahaft

Forth with the eyeball, and with dauntleas heel

Treado thern to dust. Not otherwise a bear
Pannonian, fiereer for the wound received,

Maddened by dart from Libyan thong propelled‚
Tums eimling on her wound, and still pursueo

The veapon lleeing as she whirls around. aao
rIlius, in his roge destroyed, his shepeless faoe

Stood loul with crimson fluv. The victora' ahout
Glad to the sky arose3 no greater joy

A little blood could give them had they seen

That Caesar's sell' vas wounded. Down he preeeed
Deep in his soul the anguish‚ and, nith mien

No longer bent on light, submissive cried,

‘ Spme me, ye citizens 3 remove the war

‘ Far henoe: no veapons now ean haste my death:

‘ Dran from my breast the darn, but add no more. 27⁰
‘ Yet raiae me up to plaoe me in the oamp

‘ 0f Magnus, living: this your gift to him ;

‘ No brave man's death my title to renown‚

‘ But Caesar'a flag deserted.' So he spake.

Unhappy Aulus thought hio words were true,

Nor sav within his hand the ready swerd:

And leaping forth in haste to make his own

The prisoner end his arms, in middle throat

Reoeived the lightning blade. By this one death

Rose Smeva's valour agaim and thus he eried, 280
‘ Such be the punishment of all who thought

‘ Great Sooeva vanquished; if Pompeius oeeks

‘ Peaoe lrom thia reeking sword, low let him lay
