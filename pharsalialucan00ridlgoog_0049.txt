‘Were Rome herself? His comrndes lift their hands 440
And vow ro follow wheresoe'er he lende.

And suche olamour mods the slry as when

Some Thracian blasi on Oson's plne-clod rocks

Fells heedlong, and the loud reechoing woods‚

Or bending, or rebounding from the stroke,

In munding chorus list the roer on high.

When Caeser saw them welcome thus the war

And Fortune leading on, ond favouring fetes,

And breaking up his comp set on for Rome. 450

No longer hold the warlilre Lingon down,

Fieree in his painted erms; leere ie lest,

lnho the current of more famous Rhone,

To reech the ocean in another nome.

'Ihe seir-haired people of Cevennes are free:

Nor pleasant Ver, sinoe then Imlia's bound3 400

And land alternate eloim, whene'er the tide
