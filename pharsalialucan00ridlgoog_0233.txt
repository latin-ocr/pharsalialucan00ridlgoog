soree hed he pausod3 they snotnh the hasty menl,

And seize their ermonr ond with swift eooloim
Weloome the chief 's predictions of the day,
Treod low their onmp when rushing to the light ς
And take their post: nor word nor order given,
In sete they put their trust. Nor, hadst thou placed
All caesars there, all striving for the throne
Of Rome their city, had their serried 'renlrs
With speedier treod doshed down upon the foe.
But when Pompeius saw the hostile troops 4⁰0
Move forth in order ond demand the light,
And knew the gods’ approvel of the day,
He stood astonied‚ while a deodly chill
Struck to his beart-omen itsell of woe,

Thus dread the issue: but with seer repressed‚
Borne on his noble steed along the line
Of ull his forces, thus he speke: ‘The day

6 01⁴ civil war ye asked for, is ot hond. 41⁰
‘ Put forth your strength, your all ; the sword trs-day
6 Does its last work. One crowded hour is charged
‘ With nations' destinies. Whoe'er of yon
6 Longs for his lond ond horne, his wife and child,
6 Seek thern with sword. Here in mid battle-field,
‘The gods plane all et stoke. Our better right
‘ Bids us expect their favour; they shall dip
‘ Your brands in Caesar's blood, and thus shall give
‘ Another sanction to the lows of Rome,
6 Our oause of battle. If for him were meant 420
6 An empire o'er the world, hed they not put
