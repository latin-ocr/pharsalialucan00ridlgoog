136 PHARSALIA

‘ If all the rivers that now seeh the sea

‘ Were to withdraw their waters, it would fail
‘ By not one inch‚ no more than by their flow
‘It rises now. Have then your efforts given

⁶ Strength to my cause? Not so: the heavenly gods

‘ Stoop not so low ; fate has no time to judge

‘ Your lives and deaths. The fortunes of the world

‘ Follow heroic souls: for the fit few

‘ The many live; and you who terrified

‘ With me the northern and Iberian worlds, sco
‘ Would flee when led by Magnus. Strong with me

‘ Was Labienus :¹ vile deserter now;

‘ A homeless exile with his chief prefened.

‘ Nor were your faith more firm if, neither side

‘ Espoused‚ you oeased from arms. Who leaves me once,
‘ Though not to fight against me with the foe,

·‘ Joins not my ranks again. Surely the gods

‘ Smile on these arms who lonso great a war

‘ Grant me fresh soldiers. From what heavy lond

‘ Fortune relieves me! for the hands which aimed 41⁰
‘ At all, to which the world did not suffice,

‘ Ι now diserm, and for myself alone

‘ Reserwe the conflict. Quis ye, then, my camp,

‘ And leave my standands to the grasp of men,

‘ Cowmd 'Quirites ! But some guilty few

⁴ I keep, not as their captain, but their judge.

‘ Lie‚ trsitors, prone on earth, stretch out the neck

‘ And take th' avenging blow. And thou whose strength
‘Shall now support me, young end yet untaught‚
‘Behold the doom and leam to strike and die) ⁴20
