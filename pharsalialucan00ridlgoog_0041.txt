10 PHARSALIA

Os former deys3 men wore ettire sordemus

Soerce fitly fashioned3 poverty was nomed,

Fruitful of warriors3 end from all the world 19⁰
Come thet which ruins natione3 while the fields
Furrowed of yore by great Camillus' plough,

Or by the mattocli which a Curius held,

Lost their onoc nurrow bounds, end wideniug tracto

By hinde unknown were tilled. No nation this

To theethe the sword, with tranquil peuce content

And with her liberties3 but prone to ire3

Crime holding light us though by went compelled:
Greet was the glory in the minds oi men,

Ambition lowful even ct point of sword‚ 200
To rise above their country : might their law:

Decrees were forced from Senete end from Plebs:
Consul end Tribune broke the lews aliiue:

Bought were the fasces, eud the people sold

For gaiu their favour: bribery's fatal curse

Stained every yearly contest of the Field.

Then covetous usury rose, end interest

Wus greedier with the sensnum und au trust
Wus cmuhed3 end many found a boon in war.
(ἔων hus nomed the Alps, his mighty soul 210
Goeat tumultu pondering end the coming ehock.
Now on the mnrge of Rubicon, he saw,
In face most sorrowful end ghostly guise,
His trembling oountry's image ς huge it seemed
Through miste of night obsutum end hoery heir
Streamed from the losty front with turrets crowned :
Torn were her locks und unhed were her orme
'lhen thus, with broken sighs the Vinion spnke:
‘ Whnt seek ye‚ men os Rome? end whither hence
‘ Beur ye my chundonis? 1f by right ye come, 220
‘ My citizens, stay here; these are the bounds3
