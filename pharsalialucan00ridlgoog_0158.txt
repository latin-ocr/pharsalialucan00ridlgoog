Boon v THE ORACLE 129

Her ieers approved them. On her front she binds

A twisied fillet, while e shining wreath

Of Phoeien laureis crowns the looks thet ilow

Upon her shoulders. Heeiieting yet,

The priest compelled her, end she possed within. 1⁷0
But horror filled her of the holiest depths

From which the mystic orecle proceeds ;

And resting near the deors, in breasi unmoved

She dares invent the godin words confused,

Which proved no mind possessed with lire divine3
By such false chent lece injuring the chief

Then seith in Phoebus and the secred fene.

No burst of words with tremor in their iones,

No voice re-echoing through the specious veuit
Procleimed the deity, no bristling looks 180
Shook off the leurel cheplet; but the grove
Unshaken‚ end the summits of the shrine,

Geve proof she shunned the god. The Romen knew
The tripods yet were idle, and in rege,

‘Wretch' he exclaimed, ⁴ io us end io the gods,
‘Whose presence thou pretendeet, thou shall pey
‘The punishment; unless lhou enter the recess,
‘And oeese to speek in phrases of thine own

‘of this vest condiet, oi e world by war

‘Convulsed end shaken.' Then by seer compelled, 190
At length the priestess sought the further depths‚
And sieyed beside the tripods3 end there cerne

Into her unaccusiomed breast the god,

Boeethed from the living rock for centuries
Untouched 3 nor ever with e mightier power

Did Paean's inspiration seize the freme

Of Delphic prieeiess; his perveding touch

Expelled the morial, end her former mind,

And mede her wholly his. In meddened trance
