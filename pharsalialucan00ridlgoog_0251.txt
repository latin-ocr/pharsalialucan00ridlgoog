These too shall perish. Where thy soul shall go
These shall companion thee ; no higher ssight
In airy reohns is thine, nor smoother oouch
Beneoth the Stygian darkness ς for the deod sso
No fortune favone, ond our Mother Eorth

The frosts of 'Ihrseio for the bsnks os Nile,
This year deloyed their voyage. As ne'er before
The sir grew dark with vultures' bovering wings,
Innumeroble for every grove end wood
Sent forth its denizens; on every tree
Dripped from their crimsoned beaks o gory dev.
