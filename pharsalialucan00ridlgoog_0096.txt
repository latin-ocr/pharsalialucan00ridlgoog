Boos 111 MASSILIA

Their hiding plaoes lest, a crowd appeared
Of Senatum, uncalled‚ for none could eall.
No Consul there the sacred shrine adomed 12⁰
Nor Proetor next in rank, and every seat
Plaoed sor the offioers of state was void :
Caesar was all ς his private voioe was heard ς’
All else were dumb. They sat prepared to vote
For him a throne or temple ; for themselves
Or death or exile. Thanlr the gods that he
Blushed more to order than did Rome to serve.
Yet in one breast the spirit os Freedom mse
Enragad lest foroe should override the laws ;
. For hot Metellus, when he saw the gates 13⁰
0f Satum's temple yielding to the shook,
With rapid step burst in between the ranks
0f Coesar's troops, and stood before the doors
As yet unopened. 'ris the love of gold
Alone that fears not death ; no hand is raised
For perished laws or violated rights :
But for this dross‚ the vilest cause of all,
Men fight and die. Thus did the Tribune bar
The victor's road to rapine, and with voice
Clear ringing spake: ‘Save o'er Metellus dead 1⁴0
‘This temple opens not ; my sacred blood
‘Shall how, thou rabber, ere the gold be thine.
‘And surer shall the Tribune's power defied
‘Find an avenging god3 this Crassus knew,²
‘Who‚ followed by our cursen, sought the war
‘And met disaster on the Parthian plains.

‘All Rome is empty ; draw thy salchion then,
‘Nor fear a crowd ιο gaze upon the crime.

remmom him with mysterious and ancient oursea (Plut ‘orarem’ 16.)
