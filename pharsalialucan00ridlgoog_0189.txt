PHARSALIA 3001 vr

To hew a path between his slaughtered foes. rao
Minucius' ¹ turret was the chosen spot
Where groves of trees and thickets gave approach
Safe, unbetrayed by dust. Up from the fields
Flashed all at once his eagles into sight
And all his trumpets blared. But ere the sword
Could win the battle, on the hostile ranks
Dread panio fell 3 prone as in death they lay
Where else upright they should withstand the foe;
Nor more availed their valour, and in vain
The cloud of weapons ssew, with none to slay. rao
'ihen blazing torches rolling pitohy flame
Are huded, and shaken nod the losty towers
And threaten ruin, and the bastions groan
Struck by the frequent engine‚ and the troops
0f Magnus by triumphant eagles led
Stride o'er the rampart, in their front the world.
Yet now that passage which not Coesar’s self
Nor thousand valiant squadrons had availed
To reseue from their grasp, one man in anns
Steadfast till death refused them; Scaeva named 17⁰
This hero soldier: long he served in fight
Waged 'gainst the sava-ge on the banks of Rhone;
And now centurion made, through deeds of blood,
He bore the staff ² before the marshalled line.
Prone to all wickedness, he little recked
How valourous deeds in civil war may be
Greatest of crimes; and when he saw how turned
His comrades from the war and sought in ssight

A refuge, ‘Whenoe,' he cried, ‘this impious sear
‘ Unknown to Coesar's armies? Do ye turn rao
‘ Your backs on death, and are ye not ashamed

¹ Thia was Sonva’s name.
¹ The vhawood staff was the badge of the centurion'a office.
