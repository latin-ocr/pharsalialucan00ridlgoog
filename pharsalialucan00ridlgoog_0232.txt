Boo! vu THE BA'l'rLE 203

4 Swerved from its course, hee some high ster of heaven
‘Turned buckwards, that such mighty deede should pass
4 Here on 'lheemlinn earth? Todey we reep

‘ Of all our ware the harvest or the doom. 36⁰
4 Think of theonem thet threote us, und the chain,

4 Limbs hecked asunder, Caeeer's head displayed

4 Upon the rostm; end thet nerrow field

4 Piled up with daughter: for this hostile chief

‘ Ie sevage Sulln's pupil. ”ris for you,

‘ 1f conquered, thet 1 grieve: my lot apert

‘ Is cast long since. This sword, should one of you

4 Tum from the battle ere the foe be fled,

‘ Shell rob the life of Coeser. 0 ye gods,

4 men down from heaven by the thmes of Rome, oto
4 May hehe conqueror who shall not drew

4 Agninst the venquished en inhumen sword,

4 Nor count it as e crime if men of Rome

‘ Prefened another's stnndmd to his own.

4 Pompeius' sword drank deep Italian blood

‘ When oobined in yon space the breve men's arm

4 No more found room to stm'ke. But you, 1 prey,
‘Touch not the foe who turns him fmm the fight,

‘ A fellow citizen, a foe no more.

‘ But while the gleeming weepons thoeeten still, 88⁰
‘ Let no fond memories unnerve the arm,¹

‘ No pious thought of father or of kin;

4 But full in fece of brother or of sire,

‘ Drive home the blade: of victims e'en unknown

‘ Your foes account the slaughter es a crime.

‘ Spore not our comp, but lay the rampart low

4 And fill the fosse with ruin; not e men

‘ But holds his post within the ranke today.

4 And yonder tenes, deserted by the foe,

4 Shell give us shelter when the rout is done? ³90
