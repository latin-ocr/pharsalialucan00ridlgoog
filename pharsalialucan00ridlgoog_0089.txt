58 PHARSALIA nomn

As when the famous ship¹ sought Phasis' stream
The roeky gates closed in and hardly gripped
Her flying stem ; then from the empty see
The cliffs rebounding to their ancient seat
Were fixed to move no more. But now the steps 820
Os mom epproeching tinged the eastern sky
With roseate hues: the Pleiades were dim,
The wegon os the Cherioteer grew pale,
The planete faded, and the silvery star
Which ushers in the day, was lost in light.
Thou, Magnus, hold'st the deep ; yet not the same
Now are thy fetes, as when from every sea
Thy fleet triumphant swept the pirate pest.
Tired of thy conquesrs, For-tune now no more
Shall smile upon thee. with thy spouse end sons, 8³0
Thy houeehold gods, end peoples in thy hrain,
Stin great in exile, in e distant land
Thou seek’st thy fahed fall ; not that the gode,
Wishing h) rob thee of a Roman grave,
Deereed the strande os Egypt sor thy tomb :
'Twae Italy they spared, that far away
For-tune on shores remote might hide her crime,
And Roman soil be pure of Magnus* blood.
