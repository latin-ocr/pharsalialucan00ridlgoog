PHARSALIA 1³00: r

The weight that burdened it. Thus, lowful Love,
Thus art thou tyrant o'er the mightiest mind Ξ
His sponse was the one cause why Magnus stayed
Nor met his fortunes‚ though he stuked the world
And all the destinies of Rome. The word
He speaks not though resolved; so sweet it seemed‚
When on the future poudering, to goin oro
A pause from Fate! But ot the close of night,
When drowsy sleep had fled, Cornelia sought
To soothe the anxious bosom of her lord
And wiu his kisses3 when nmoned she saw
His oheek wns teorful, aud with boding soul
Shrenk from the hidden wound, nor drued surprise
Magnus in tems. But sighing thus he spnke:
‘Dearer to me than life iuer, when life
‘Is happy (not at momento such es these);
‘The day of sorrow comes, too long deloyed, ⁸50
‘Nor long enough! With Caesar at our gates
‘With all his forces, a secure retreat
‘shall Iasbos give thee. Try me not with prayers.
‘This fatal boon I have denied myself.
‘Thou wilt not long be absent from thy spouse.
‘ Disosters husten, und things highest sall
‘With speediest ruin. 'Tis enough for thee
‘To hear of Magnus' peril; and thy love
‘Deceives thee with the thought thot thou canst gaze
‘Unmoved on civil strife. It shnrnes my soul 860
‘On the eve of war to slumber at thy side,
‘And rise from thy deor breost when trumpots call
‘A woeful world to misery und arms.
· ‘ 1 dread lest Magnus in this war endure
‘Nor loss nor sorrow. But do thou lie hid
‘Sofer than kings or peoples, for removed ;
‘That so the grievous fortunes os thy lond
‘Moy lighter sall ou theo. 11· uukiud heaven
