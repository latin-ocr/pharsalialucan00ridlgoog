And careless of the frey, when sust a stood
Pieroed through by javeiin sparned with soanding hoof
The temples of his rider, turned the rein,
And through their oomrades spurring from the field
In panio, proved that not with waning Rome
Barbariana may grapple. Then arose
Immeasurable oamage: here the sword,
There stood the rietim, and the viotor's arm sao
Wearied oi slaughter. Oh, that to thy plains,
Pharsalia, might suffice the en'mson stream
From hosts barbarian, nor other blood
Pollute thy sountains' souroas! these alone
Shall elothe thy pasturas with the bones of men!
0r if thy fields must run with Roman blood
'rhen spare the nations who in times to come
Must be her peoples!
Now the terror spread
Through all the army, and the favouring fetes
Decreed for Coesar's triumph: and the war oro
Ceased in the wider plain, though still ablaze
Where stood the chosen of Pompeius' foroe,
Upholding yet the sight. Not here allies
Begged from some distant king to wield the sword:
Here were the Romm sons, the sires of Rome,
Here the last fmzy and the last despair:
Here, Caesar, was thy crime: and here shall stay
My Muse repelled: no poesy of mine
Shall tell the horrors oi the final striie,
Nor for the oomingagespaint the deeds sao
Which civil war permits. Be all obseured
In deepest darkness! Spare the useless tear
And vain lament, and let the deeds that fell
In that last sight of Rome remain unsung.

But Caesar adding fury to the breasts
