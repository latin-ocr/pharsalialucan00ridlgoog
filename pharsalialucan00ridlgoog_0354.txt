Within the narrow comens of a house
He seeks for sefety3 on the portsls closed
His hope of life: and with unoertain gsit
He tiendo the hulls; yet not without the King;
In pmpme, Ptolomeus, that thy life
For his shall give atonement; and to huri ooo

Nor yet the tmots which chill lbems ginis,

Nor Libyan coasts such wiokedness have dated,

As thou, and all thy minions. Closer now ooo
War hemmed thern in, and neopons in the oousts,
Shahing the innermost reoesses, felt

Yet did no rom, fatal with single stroke,

Assail the portal, nor machine of παῖς
