Booxv THE STORM 141

Might breed abhorrenoe: for from either camp
Voioee were clearly heard and features seen.
Nor e'er, Pompeius, sinoe that distant day
When Caeser's daughter and thy sponse wes rest
By pitiless sete away, nor left a pledge,
Did thy loved hincman (save on sends of Nile)
So nearly look upon thy fece again. ooo
But Coeser's mind though frenzied for the fight
Wes foroed tn pause until Antonius brought
The rearward troops; Antonius even now
Reheersing leuces' light. With prayere ond threots
Coeeer exhorte him. ‘Why deley the fetes,
‘Thou oense of evil to the suffering world?
‘My epeed heth won the major pert: from thee
‘ Fortune demands the 111111 stroke alone.
‘ Do Libyan whirlpoole with deoeitful tideo
6 Unoertein seperate us? Is the deep neo
6 Untried to which 1 call? To unknown risks
6 Art thou oommnnded? cesar bids thee come,
‘ Thou sluggeni, not to leave him. long ego
‘ I ren my ships midway through sends and shoels
‘ To barbours held by foen ; and dost thou sear
‘ My friendly camp? 1 mourn the waste of days
‘ Which lete allotted us. Upon the waves
6 And winds 1 eall unoensing: hold not beck
6 Thy willing troops, but let them dare the seo3
6 Here gledly shall they come to join my camp, 57⁰
6 Though risking shipwreck: with indignant voioe

‘ 1 eall upon thee. Not in equel ahares
6 The world has fallen between us : thou alone

6 Dost hold 111111, but Epirus I

6 And 111 the lords of Rome) Twice oelled and thrice
Antonius lingered still: but Caeenr's mind
Wes that he failed the gods, not they his cause.
