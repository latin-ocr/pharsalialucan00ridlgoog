290 PHARSALIA Boon lx

Sole of all serpents Scytala to shed
In vernal frosts his slough; and thirsty Dipsas 3
Dread Amphisbaena with his double head
Tapering3 and Natrix who in bubbling fount
Fuses his venom. Greedy Prester swells
His foeming jans ς Pareas, head erent
Furrows with tail alone his sandy path ;
Swift J aculus there, and Seps whose poisonous juioe
Makes liquid bone and flesh: and there upreared ⁸50
His regal head, and frighted from his traak
With sibilant terror all the subject swarm,
Baneful ere darts his poison, Basilisk ¹
In sands deserted king. Ye serpente too
Who in all other regions hsrmless glide
Adored as gods, and bright with golden scales,
Are deadly here : for Afric air inhaled
Bestaws malignant gift, as poised on wings
Whole herds os hine ye follow, and with eoils
Encircling close, crush in the mighty bull. 8⁶⁰
Nor does the elephant in his giant bulk,
Nor aught, find safety3 and ya need no fang
Nor poison, to compel the fatal end.
Amid these pests undaunted Cato urged
His desert joumey on. His hardy troops
Beneath his eyes, pricked by a scanty wound,
In strangest forms of death unnumbered fall.
Tyrrhenian Aulus, bearer of a flag,
de on a Dipsas; quick with head reversed
The serpent structu no mark betrayed the tooth : 87⁰

The aspect of the wound nor threatened death,

¹ The glanae ot tha eye of the basiltsk or aoakstrioa was supposed to ba
deadly. Sea ‘King Biehard 111.‚’ Act t, Saena 2 :-
