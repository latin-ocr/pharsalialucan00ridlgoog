Boot VI THE WITCH OF THESSALIA 179

Plaased that her impious fame was noised ahroad
Thus made her answer : ‘If some lesser lates
⁴ Thy wish had been to change, against their wish
‘ It had been easy to compel the gods 720
‘ To its accomplishment. My art has power
‘ When ol one man the constellations praes
‘ The speedy death, to composa a delay ;.
‘ And mihe it is, though every star decrees
‘ A ripe old age, by mystic herbs to shear
‘ The life midway. But should some purpose set
‘ From the beginning of the universe,
‘ And all the labouring fortunes of mankind,
‘ Be brought in question, theu Thessalian art
‘ Bows to the power supreme. But if thou be 7³0
‘ Content to know the issue pre-ordained,
‘ Simple the tosk and plain ς for earth and air
⁴ And sea and space and Rhodopoean crags
‘ Shall speak the future. Yet it easiest seems
“ ⁴ Where death in these Thessalian fielda abounds¹
‘ To raise a single corpse. From dead men's lips

⁶ Scaree cold, in fuller aocents falls the voioe;

‘ Not from some mummied frumein aooents shrill
‘ Unoertain to the ear?

Thus spake the hag
And through redoubled night, a squalid veil 7⁴0
Swathing her pallid features, stole among
Unbun'ed oaroaaes. Fast fled' the wolves,
The carrion birds with maw unsatisfied
Relaxed their talons, as with creeping step
She sought her prophet. Firm must be the llesh
As yet, though cold in death, and firm the lungs
Untouched by wound. Now in the balance hung
The lates os slain unnumbered; had she striven

¹ The poet fuls the plain nith dead before the battle is fought.
