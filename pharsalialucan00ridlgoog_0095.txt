PHARSALIA 1300: 111

What long army of triumph had he brought!
What pictured soenoe os battle! how hod Rhine

And Ocean borne his chains! How noble Gaul,
And Britein's fair-haired chicfs his losty cor
Had followed! Such o triumph hod he lost 9⁰
By further conquest. Now in silent fear
They watched his menching troops, nor joyful towns
Poumd out their crowds to welcome his retum.
Yet did the conqueror's proud soul rejoice,
Fur more than at their love, ot such a feor.

Now Anxur'e hold was possed, the oory ruod
'l'hat separator the marsh, the grove sublime ¹
Where reigns the Scythian goddess, and thc path
By which meu bear the fasces to the feast
On Albe's summit. From the height afer- mo
Gezing in awe upon the walle os Rome
His native city, since the Nol-thern war ’
Unseen‚ unvisited-thus Caesar speke:
‘Seot of the gode, have men deserted thee,
‘Thee, Rome, without a blow? 'lhen for what town
‘Shull men do battle? Thank the gods, no host
‘From Eostern climee hos sought Italia's shores
‘ To wreak its huy ς nor Sarmatian horde
‘ With northern tribes conjoined; by Fortune's gift
‘This war is civil ι eloe this coward chief 110
‘ Hod been thy ruin'

Tremhling at his feet

He found the city: doadly fire and fleme,
As from a conqueror; gode and fonce dispemed;
Such was the mensure os their sear, as though
His power aud wish were one. No feetal shout
Greeted his march, no feigned cocleim of joy.

Scame had they time for hate. In Phoebus' hall
*nminem (marmiun, ee.)
