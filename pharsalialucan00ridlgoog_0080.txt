Boos 11 THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS 49

6. Swist es ye cen, 1110 bridge 11101 spons 111011100ος

6 And thou, O n'ver, from thy mountain soume

6 With all thy 10110011 rushing, plenks and beems

‘ Ruined end broken on thy foeming breest

6 Beer onward 1ο the seo. The wer 110111 pause

6 Here, et these bounds : here shall this heodlong chief

6 Aweit in idleness our victory?
He bade his squodrons, speeding from 1110 wells,
Charge on 1110 bridge : in vain: 101 Cesar saw

They sought 10 free 1110111101 from his ohuins¹ 110
And ber his march ; and roused 10 110, he osred:

6 Were 001 the walls sufficient to protect
6 Your oowurrl souls? Seek ye by barncodes
6 And streums 1ο keep me back? What though 1110110011

‘ 01 swollen Ganges were across my path?

6 Now Rubicon is possed, 00 stream on 001111
6 8111111 hinder Coeser! Forwanl, horse end foot,
‘ And ere it tollens rush upon the bridge.'
Urged in their swiftest gullop 10 the 11001
Dashed 1110 light horse across 1110 sonnding plain ; noo
And suddenly, es 010110 10 summer, ssew
A cloud 01 jevelins forth, by sinewy arms
Hurled at the foe; the guard is put 10 ssight,
And conquering Caeser, seizing 00 the bridge,
Compels 1110 enemy 10 keep 1110 walls.
Now do the mighty engines, soon 10 hurl
Gigantic stenes, press forwerd, end theram
Creeps 'neoth the ramparls 3 when 1110 gabee fly beck,
And lo! the treitor troops (foul crime in wer)
Yield up 111011 leeder. Η101 they pleoe before 170
His proud oompatn‘ot3 yet with upright form,
And soornful features oud with noble mien,

¹ Thon is 10 say, by the breaking ol 1110 bridge, the river would beoome
11 serious obstacle to cesar.
