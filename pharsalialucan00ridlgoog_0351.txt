‘ There lies the shore that bids us hope success z

‘ Ask of our power from the polluted wave,

‘ And goze upon the scanty tomb which holds

‘ Not all Pompeius' ashes. Peer to him

4 Was he whom now thou fearest. Noble blood,

‘ True, is not ours: what boots it? Nor are realms 400
4 Nor wealth of peoples given to our command.

4 Yet have we risen to a height ol' power

‘ For deeds of blood, and Fortune to our hands

‘ Attracts her victims. Lo 1 a nobler now

4 Lies in our compasS, and a second death

4 Hesperia shall appease3 for Caesar's blood,

4 Shed by these hands, shall give us this, that Rome

4 Shall love us, guilty of Pompeius' fall. ’

4 Why sear these titles, why this chicstain's strength Ρ

4 For shorn of these, before your swords he lies 440
4 A common soldier. To the civil war

4 This night shall bring completion, and shall give

‘ To peoples slain fit offerings, and send

4 That life the world demands beneath the shades.

4 Rise then in all your hanlihood and smite

4 This Coesar down, and let the Roman youths

4 Strike for themselves, and Lagos for its King.

4 No do thou tarry: full of wine and feast

‘ Thou'lt fall upon him in the lists of love 3

4 ’114044 dare the venture, and the heavenly gods 400

4 Shell grant of csto's and of Brutuv' prayers
4 Το thee sulfilment?

Nor was Achillas slow
To hear the voice that counselled him to crime.
No sounding clarion summoned, as is wont,
His troops to arms ; nor trumpet blare betrayed

Their nightly march: but rapidly he seized
All needed instrumente of blood and war.
