Now to the Roman standards are they come, 107⁰

And when the chiettain bade the tents be lixed,
First all the sendy space within the lines
With song they purity and megic words
From which ull serpente fiee: next round the comp
In widest circuit from a lrindled lire
Rise aromatic odours : denewort burns,
And juioe distils from Syrien galbanum ς
Then mournful tamarim, costum from the Eust,
Strong panacea mixed with oenteury
From Thrace, and leaves of fennel seed the flames, 10⁸0
And thapsus brought from Eryx: and they burn
Inrch, southern-wood end antlers of a deer
Which lived efer. From these in deusest firmes,
Deadly to snakes, a pungent smoke erose;
And thus in safety passed the night away.
But should some vietim feel the fatal fang
Upon the merch, then of this magio rece
Were seen the wonders3 with solive first
They smeer the limb‚ whose silent working keeps ¹
The venom in the wound. From forming mouth 109⁰
Next with continuous cadence would they pour
Unceosing chants-nor breething space nor pause—
Else spreads the poison: nor does fote permit
A moment's silence. 0st from the black llesh

⁴ Flies forth the pest benemh the mugio song:
But should it linger nor obey the voioe,
Repugnent to the summoue, on the wound
Prostrete they loy their lips end from the depths
Now peling drew the venom. ln their mouths,
Sucked from the freezing tlesh‚ they hold the doeth, 1100
Then spew· it forth ; end from the teste shall know

The nature of the snake whose bite they cure.
