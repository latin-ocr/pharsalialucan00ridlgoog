298 PHARSALIA 1³00: rx

Thus helped, the Roman host with lighter heert
Trod through the barren fields in lengthy moreh.l
Twioe veiled the moon her light end twioe renewed;
Yet still, with waning or with growing orb
Sew Ceto's steps upon the sendy wesie.

But more und more benesth their feet the dost

Began to handen, till the Libyan trecis

Once more were earth, end in the disienee rose ruo
Some grores ol soenty foliage, and huis

Of pleshered sirew unieshioned: end their heerts
Leeped st the prospect of a better laud.

How ssed their sorrow! how with growing joy

They met the sevege lion in the path !

ln tranquil Leptis first they found retreat t

And pumed s winter free from hest end rain.²

When Caeser saled with Emathia's slein
Forsook the batuefield, all other oeres

Neglecled, he punsued his kinsmen fled, 112⁰
0n him alone intent: by lund his steps

He lraoed in vsin; then, rumour for his gulde,

He crossed the see snd reached lhe Thracian struit

For love renowned; where on the mournful shore

Rose Hero's lower, and Helle born of cloud³

Toolr from the rolling weves their former neme.
Nowhere wilh shorber space the sea divides
Europe from Asis3 though Pontus peris
