310 PHARSALIA

In paiaoe haunted by Pompeius* shade,
Gave plaoe to love; and in adulterous bod,
Magnus forgotten‚ from the Queen impure,
To J ulia gave a brother: on the bounds
Of iurthest Libya permitting thus
His foe to gether: while in daldianoe base
He waited on his mistress, andto her
Pharos would giwe; ior her would conquer all.
Thon Cleopatra, trusting to her charms,
Tearloss approaohed him, though in form of grief ;
Her besses loose aa though in sorrow torn,
So bat beooming her; and thus began:
‘ If, mighty Caesar, ought to noble birth
‘Be due, give ear. Of Lagian raoe am I roo
6 Offspring illustrious3 from my father's throne
6 Cast forth to banishment; unloes thy hand
6 Roetore to me the sceptro: then a Queen
‘ Falls at thy feet embraoing. To our raoe
⁶ Bright star of justioe thou! Nor first shall 1
‘ As woman rule the citios of the Nile ς

‘ For, neither sex preferring‚ Pharos bows

‘To quoenly governanoe. Of my parted tire
‘ Read the last words, by which 'tis mine to share

6 With equal rights the kingdom and the bed. lio
‘ And the boy loves his sister, were he free;

‘ But his affectione and his sword alike

6 Pothinus orders. Nor wioh 1 myseli

6 Το wield my father's power; bnt this my prayer:

‘ Save from this foui disgraoe our royal house,

6 Bid that the king shall reign, and from the court

6 Remove this hatefwl variet, and his arms.

6 How swells his bosom for that his the hand

‘ That shore Pompeius' hond! And now he threats

6 Thoe, Coeaar, also; which the Fater awert! 120
