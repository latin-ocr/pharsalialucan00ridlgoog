PHARSALIA Boou 111

His oxen gone which else had drawn the plough, 510
Moums for hia harvoet.

But the eager chief
Impatient of the combat by the walls
Caniea the warfare to the lurtheat west.
Meanwhile a giant mound‚ on star-shaped wheels
Conoealed they fashiom crowned with double towers
High as the battlementa, by oauae unseen

Slow meeping onwarda; while amared the soe

Beheld, and thought some subterranean gost

Had buret the oaverns of the earth and lamed

The nodding pile alost, and wondered aore ⁶20
Their walls should stand unshaken. From its height
Hisaed down the weapons; but the Grecian bolta

With gneater soree were on the Romans hurled;

Nor by the arm unaided‚ for the lance

Urged by the catapult resistless mshed

Through arms and ahield and llesh, and left a death
Behind, nor stayed its course: and massive atonea

Cast by the beams of mighty engines fell;

As from the mountain top some time-wom rook

At length by winda dialodged‚ in all its track 530
Spreads ruin vast: nor cnrshed the lile alone

Forth from the body, but dispersed the limbs

In fragmenta undistinguiahed and in blood.

But as protectod by the armour shield

The might of Rome drew nigh beneath the wall

(The front rank with their buclders interlaoed

And held above their helms)‚ the missiles fell

Behind their books, nor could the toiling Greeks
Deflect their engines, throwing still the bolta

Far into space ; but from the rampart top mo

Flung ponderous messes down. Longas the shields
Held firm together, like to hail that falls
