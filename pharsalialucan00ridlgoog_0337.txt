PHARSALIA nmx

Snetehed off by fate, in vengeenoe for the world.
In sacred sepulchre the hero's limbs‚

Which should be scettered o'er the earth, repom,
Still spered by Fortune to these tyrant days:
For in a world to heedom once recelled,

All men hed mocked the dust of him who set
The beneful leeson that so many lands

can serve one mester. Macedon he lest

His home obscure; Athena he despieed‚

The conquest of hie sire, and spurred by faie
Through Asia rushed with hovoe of mankind,
Plunging his sword through peoples; red with blood
¹Unknown to them Euphrates, Ganges ren.

Curse of all earth, fell star of evil fote

To every notion! On the outer eea

He leunehed his fleet to nil the ocean weve:

Nor fleme nor flood nor sterile Libyen sends 40

Smyed beck his oourse‚ nor Hammon's pethlees shoels3
Fer to the west, where downwmd elopee the world

He would have led his armies, end the polee

Had oompmeed end bed drunk the fount of Nile:

But neme his latest dey3 euch end alone

Could nature place upon the madmen king,

Who jealous in death es when he won the world

His empire with him took, nor lest en heir.

Thus every city to the spoiler's hand

Wns vietim mede. Yet in his fall was his oo
Babylon ς and Parthie feered him. Shame on us
Thot Eestern natione dreaded more the lanoe

Of Meoedon then now the Romen spent.

True that we nde beyond where takes ite rise

The burning southern breere, beyond the homes

Of weetem winde, end to the northern star3
