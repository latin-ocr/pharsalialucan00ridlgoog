Armies to mise and order back to life

Whole ranke oi mammos, the lawe hod failed 760
Of Erebus3 ond, summoned up from Styx, .

lu ghostly tenonis had obeyed her ooll,

And rising fought onoe more. At length the witoh
Picks out her victim with piorood throot agape

Fit for her purpose. Grippod by pitileos hook

O'er rocks she drago him to the mountain cave
Aooursed by her fell rius, that shall restore

The dead mou's life. Clooe to the hidden brink

The land thot girds the precipioe of hell

Sinko towards the depths: with ever falling leaves no
Α wood o'emhodows, and a spreoding yew

Costa shode impenetrable, Foul deoay

Fills all the spooe, ond in the deep reoess

Dorkness unbroken, save b'y ohonted spells,

Reigns ever. Not where gope the misty jaws

0f caverned Tmarus, the gloomy bound

of either world, through which the nether kings

Permit the passage of the deod to earth,

So poisonous‚ mephitic, hungo the oir.

Noy, though the witch hod power to ooll the shadeo 770
Forth from the depthn, 'twos doubtful ii the cave

Were not a port of hell. Disoorduut hues

Flamed on her gorb os by a fury worm

Bure was her visoge, ond upon her brow

Dread vipers hiosed. beneath her otreaming looks

ln sablo coils entwined. But when she saw

The youth'o oomponions trembling, and himself

With eyes onst down, with vinage as of death,

Thus spoke the witoh: ‘Forbid your oraven soulo
‘ These soors to cherish: soon returning life too
‘ This frome shall quioken‚ and in tonos which roooh

‘ Even the timorous eor shall speak the man.
