Such were his words, and Coesur's gracious smile 41⁰
Granted his prayer, remitting rights thst war
Gives to the victor. To th' unguuuled stream
The soldiers speed: prone on the bank they lie
And lap the flood or foul the crowded waves.

Craved water for itseli. lhen, uerved once more,
Their strength returned. Oh, lavish luxury, 42⁰

Oh, greed that seamhest over land and ses

To furnish forth the banquet! Pride that joy'st
ln sumptuous tables! leam what lise requires,
How little nature needs! No ruddy juioe
Pressed fmm the vintsge in some famous yeer,
