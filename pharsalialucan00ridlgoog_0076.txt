Boos 11 THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS 45

On Cato's lineamenis the marks of grief

Were still unsostened, and the hoary hair 420
Hung o'er his reverend visage ; for since first

Men flew to orme, his looks were leit unhempt

To stream upon his brow, and 00 his chin

His beard uniended grew. 'swas his alone

Who hated not, nor lored, 100 all mankind

To moum aliie. Nor did their former couch

Again receive them, for his lofty soul
E'en lawful love resisted. 'Twas his rule ¹

Inflexible, to keep the middle path
Marked out and bounded; to observe the laws 430
01 natural right; and for his country's sake
To risk his life, his all, es not 100 self
Brought into being, but for all the world:
Such was his creed. To him a sumptuous feast
Was hunger conquered, and the lowly hui,
Which scaros kept out the winter, was a home
Equal to palaoes: a robe of price
Such hairy garments as were worn of old:
The end of marriage, offspring. To the State
Fsther alike and husband, right and law 400
Ηο ever followed with unswerving step:
No thought of selfish pleasure turned the scale
In Cato's acts, 00 swayed his upright soul.
Meanwhile Pompeius led his trembling host
To iields Campanian, and held the walls
F irst founded by the chief of 'l'rojon raoe.
These chose he for the central seat of war,

Some troops despatching who might meet the foe
Where shady Apennine lifts up the ridge
Of mid Italia; nearest to the sky 400

¹ ¹1 know not three wiser precepto for the conduct either of princes or
private men! Sir W. Temple, i. 184, quoting this passage.
