PHARSALIA

In stagnant pools upon the mournful deep:
Agrinst the course of nature luy outshetehed

Arigidooean: 'twssssifhheses

Forgeh iu ancient ways end knew no more

The oeeseless tides, nor any breeze of heaven,

Nor quivered at the image of the sun,

Mirrored upon its wore. For while the fleet

Hung in mid passage motionless, the foe

Might hurry to attach, with sturdy stroke

Chuming the deep3 or fumine's deadly grip 520
Might seize the ships beculmed. For dangers new
New vows they found: for tempests was their prayer,
To rouse she billows hill the watery plain

Freed from its torpor should be sea onoe more.

But cloudless was the sky and calm the deep,

All hope of shipwreck gone, till night was fied,

And merred by guthering mist the day urose

And stined the depths, end mowed the fleet along
Towsrds the Gerounion heedlond3 and the woves

And favouring breeoes followed on the ships, 5³0
Now speeding foster, till (their goul otteined)

They onst their anchors on Palaeshe's ¹ shore.

This lond first sow the ehiefs in neighbouring camps

confronred, which the streems of Apsus bound

And swister Genusus; a lenghhy course

Is run by neither, buton Apsus' waves

Seoroe flowing from e marsh, the frequent boot

Finds room to swim; while on the foemy bed

of Genusus by sun or shower compelled

The melted snows pour seswurds. Here were meh 640
(So Fortune ordered it) the mighty peir3

And in iu woes the world yet vsinly hoped

Thur, brought io nemer touch, their crime iuelf

¹ As the loot of lhe Asroosruuuisn range.
