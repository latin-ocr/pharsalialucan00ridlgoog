138 PHARSALIA Boon v

Clothing hia power3 and etamped upon the time
A worthy designatiom for what name
Could better mark the dread Pharsalian year
Than ‘Caesen Consul' ?¹ Now the famous field
Pretends its ancient oeremoniea: oalls
The tribea in order and divides the votes
In vain solemnity of empty urna.
Nor did they heed the portento of the sky:
Deaf were the augura to the thunder roll; too
The owl ssew on the left; yet were the birds
Propitious sworn. Then was the ancient name
Degraded first; and monthly Consule,² now
Shorn of their rank, were chosen to mark the yeara
And Trojan ΑΠκιίῑ8 god (since Latium's fall
Deserving not) beheld the wonted firee
Blaze frorn hia altare on the featal night.

Then through Apulia'e follows, which her hinds
Left all untilled, to aluggish weeds a prey
Passed Caesar onward, awifter than the {ire 47⁰
of heaven, or tigreae dam: until he reached
Brundusium'a winding ramparts‚ built of old
By Cretan oolonista. There icy winds
Constrained the billows, and his trembling fleet
Feared for the winter atorma nor dared the main.
But Caesar's soul burned at the momente lost
For epeedy battle, nor could brook delay
Within the port, indignant that thesea
Should give safe passage to hia routed foe:

¹ Cesar was named Dictator while at Massilia. Entering Rome, he
held the office for aleran days only. bnt war elected consul for the tnoom·
ing year, ac. 48, along with Servilius leaurioue. (Caesar, ‘De Bello civili:
iit, 1 ; Manrale, chapter xvi.)

¹ In tha time of tha Empire, the degreded Gomulahip. maroneo only
aa a name, was frequently mnasoned at monthly‚ or even ehorter, intervala
from one favourite to another.

¹ onear performed the solemn riter of the great Iatin festival on the
Alban Mount during nn Dictatorehip. (Compare Book vn„ line 471.)
