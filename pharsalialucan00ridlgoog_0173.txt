PHARSALIA

⁴ And trod the margin with unsteady gait.

‘ But if the oause demands, behold me thine.

‘ Either we reach the bidden shore, or else

‘ Storm and the deep forbid—we ean no more'
Thus said he loosed the boat and raised the sail.

No sooner done than stars were seen to fall

In flaming furrows from the sky: nay, more3

The pole star trembled in its place on high :

Black horror marked the surging of the sea;

The main was boiling in long tracts of foam, 650

Uncertain of the wind, yet seized with storm.

Then spake the oaptain of the trembling berk:
‘ See what remorseless ooean has in store !

‘ Whether from east or west the storm may come
‘ Is still uncertain, for as yet oonfused

‘ The billows tumble. Judged by clouds and sky
‘ A western tempest: by the murmuring deep

‘ A wild south-eastern gale shall sweep the sea.

‘ Nor bark nor man shall reaoh Hesperia's shore

‘ In this wild rage of waters. To return sao
‘ Baek on our oourse forbidden by the gods,

‘ Is our one refuge, and with labouring boat

‘ To reach the shore ere yet the nearest land

But great Caesar's trust
Was in himself, to make all dangers yield.
And thus he answered: ‘Soom the threatening sea,
‘ Spread out thy oanvas to the raging wind;
‘ If for thy pilot thou refusest heaven,
‘ Me in its stead reoeive. Alone in thee
‘ One rause of terror just-thou dost not know sto
‘ Tiry oomrade, ne'er deserted by the gods,
‘ Whom fortune blesses e'en without a prayer.
‘ Break through the middle storin and trust in me.
