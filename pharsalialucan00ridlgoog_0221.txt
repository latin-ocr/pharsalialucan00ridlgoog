And when Sertorius* armies fought and fled,

He sat triumphent for the west subdued,

In pure white gowu, and heard the senate oheer;

No less majestis es a Roman knight 2⁰
Thon had the purple robe adorned his oar.

Perhaps, os ills drew near, his anxious soul,

Shuuning the future, wooed the happy pest3

Or, ns is wont, prophetie slumber showed

'rhet which was not to be, by doubtful forms
Misleoding3 or as envious Fete forbode

Retum to Italy, thie glimpse of Rome

Kind Fortune gave. Breok not his latest sleep,

Ye sentinels ; let not the trumpet cell

Strike on his ear: for on the morrow's night eo
Shepes of the battle lost, of death end wer

shall crowd hie rest with terrors. Whenoe sholt thou
The poor mon's happiness of sleep regain?

Heppy if thus, e'en thus, thy Rome oould see

Onoe more her captain ! Would the gods had given
To thee and to thy oountry one day yet

To reep the latest fruit of such a love:

Though sure of fate to come! Thou merchest on

As though by heaven ordeined in Rome to die ;

She, conscious ever of her prayers for thee 4ο
Heoud by the gods, deemed not the fetes decreed

Such evil destiny, thet she should lose

The lest sad soloce of her Magnus' tomb.

Then young end old had blent their team for thee,

And child unbidden; women torn their heir

And struck their bosoms as for Brutus dead.
