PHARSALIA uooerx

Still doubting, and in ull the Libyan waste

There only was he first to touch the stream.
Why fertile thus in death the pestileut air

Of Libya, what poison in her eoil

Her several nature mixed, my cere to know

Has not avsiled: but from the days of old

A fabled story has deceived the world.

Far on her limite, where the buming shore
Admits the ocean ferwid from the suu
Plunged in its naurs, lay Medusa's fields
Untilled; nor foreste sheded, nor the plough
Furrowed the soil, which by its mistress' gene
Was herdened into stoue: Phorcus, her sire.
Melevolent nature from her body first
Drew forth these noisome pests ; first bom her jews 74⁰
Issued the sibilant settle of serpent tongum
Clustered eround her head the poisonous blood
Like to e womun's heir, wueathed on her neck
Which gloried in their touch; their glittering heeds
Advanoed towenis her; and her tresses kempt
D1ipped down with viper's venom. This alone
Thou hest, sccursed one, which men can see
Unhermed3 for who upon thet geping mouth
Looked and could dread? Whom suffered she bo die
Who saw her fece? He msbed upon his fate roo
And ere he feered was strichen to the death.
Perished the limbs while living, and the soul
Grew stiff and stark ere yet it fled the frume.
Men have been fieuzied by the Furies' looks,
Not killed ; end Cerberus et orpheus* song
Ceesed from his hissing, and Alcides saw
The Hydra ere he slew. This monster born
Brought horror with her birth upon her sire
Phorcus, iu second order God of werec,
