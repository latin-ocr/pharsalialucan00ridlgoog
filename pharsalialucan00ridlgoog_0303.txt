PHARSALIA nomn:

Desert their empty comb, surget the hive,
Ceasing to cling together, and with wings
Untrammelled seek the air, nor slothful light
On thymo to tacte its bitternoes—then rings
The Phrygian gong-at once they pause alost
Astonied; and with love of toil resumed
'lhrough all the flowers ior their honey otore ³50
ln ceaselees wanderings search3 the ahephenl joys,
Sure that th' Hyblaean mead for him hos kept
H is cottage stone, the riches of his home.

Now in the active conduct of the war

Were brought to discipline their minda, untuught

To beor repose; first on the sandy shore

Toiling they learned fatigue: then stormed thy walls,
Cyrene3 prizeless, forto Cato's mind

Twas price enough to conquer. J uba next

He bids approach, though Nature on the path nco

Had placed the Syrtes; which his sturdy heart
Aspired to conquer. Either at the first
When Nature gave the universe ita form

She leit this region neither land nor sea;

Not wholly shrunk, so that it should receive
The ocean flood3 nor firm enough to stand
Against ita buffeta-all the pathlecs coast

Lies in uncertain shape; earth by the deep

ls parted from the land3 on sandy banks

Τὴε seas are broken, and frorn shoal to shoal ³70
The wareo advanoe to sound upon the shore.
Nature, in spite, thus lest her work undone,
Unfashioned to men's use-Or else of old

A foeming ocean filled the wide expense,

But Titan feeding from the briny depths

His buming firee (near to the zone of heat)
