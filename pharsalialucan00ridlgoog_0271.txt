⁴ 0f Crassus, captive, shall to him be brought 4⁷⁰
⁴ As spoil of former oonquest If the wound

⁴ Redis yon wall where passed their headless tnmks3

⁴ Euphrates here engulfed thern, Tigris there

⁴ Cast up to perish. Gaze on such array, sno
⁴ And thou oanst supplioate at Coesar's feet

‘ In mid Thessalia seated. Nay, thy glanoe

‘ Turn on the Roman world, and if thou fear'st
