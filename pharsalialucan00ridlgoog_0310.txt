Boon lx CATO 281

Which held them motionless. And from afar
Where walls lay prostrate, mighty stones were hurled,
Thus piling ills on ills in wondrous form: ⁵70
No dwellings had they seen, yet at their feet
Beheld the ruins. All the earth was hid
ln vast envelopment, nor found they guide
Save from the star-s, which as in middle deep
Flamed o'er them wandering: yet some were hid
Beneath the circle of the Libyan earth
Which tending downwards hid the Northem sky.
When wannth disperscd the tempestdriven air,
And rose upon the earth the flaming day,
Bathed were their limbs in sweat, but parchcd and dry oso
Their gaping lips3 when to a scanty spring
Far off beheld they came, whose meagre drops
All gathered in the hollow of a helm
They offered to their chief. Caked were their throats
With dust, and panting; and one little drop
Had made him envied. ‘Wretch, and dost thou deem
⁶ Me wanting in a brave man's hcart ?’ he cried‚
‘ Me only in this throng? And have l seemcd
‘ Tender, unfit to bear the morning heat?
‘ He who would quench his thirst 'mid such a host, oso
‘ Doth most deserve its pangs' Then in his wrath
Dashod down the helmet, and the scanty spring,
Thus by their leader spumed, sufficed for all.
Now had they reached that temple which possess,
Sole in all Libys, th' untutorcd tribes
Of Garamanticus. Here holds his seat
(So saith the story) a prophetic Jove,
Wielding no thunderbolts, nor like to oum
'lhe Libyan Hammon of the cumtd horn.
No wealth adorna his fane by Afric tribes ooo
’ Bestowcd, nor glittering hoard of Eastern gems.
