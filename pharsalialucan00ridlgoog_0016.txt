PREFACE

THE SECOND EDITION

-ωμ-

ln offering to the public another edition of this work 1 have

taken the opportunity of revising and correcting the text
where it seemed to be necessary or advisahle to do ao.

With the exception of Francken's second volume, com·
prising Books VI.-X., I am not avare that any new book on
Lucan has appeared since my own translation was published
in 1896. But Francken's readings and commentary oer-
tainly throw new light on a variety of difficult and obscure
passages, aad 1 have in more cases than one taken advantage
of his carehrl yet ingenious suggestions. 1 need not repeat
that I make no claim to be a learned or a critical scholar;
and Ι confess, for instance, that Isound myself puzzled,
when first I had to deal with it, with the phrase ‘Stantes
serpente gigantea* Book IX. 771 (656 of the original). I
took refuge in a literal translation. But Francken gives the
clue required when he points to an altar at Pergamus which

shows the giants fashioned with tails of serpents. There are,
however, many instances where, without the aid of a new

commentator,l have found occasion to rectify what lmust
admitto have been inaccuracies‚ and to improve or replace
lines which were faulty3 and Ι venture to hope that this

revised edition may meet with approval.
