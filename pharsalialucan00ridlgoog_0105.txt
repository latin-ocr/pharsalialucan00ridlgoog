‘ For us, this is our prayer: leave, Caesar, here 380
‘ Thy dreadful angles, keep thy hostile signs

‘ Back from our gates, but enter thou in peaoe

⁶ Massilia's ramparts; let our city rest

‘ Withdrawn from crime, to Magnus and to thee

‘ Safe: and should favouring fate preserve our walls

‘ Inviolan, when both shall wish for peace

‘ Here meet unarmed. Why hither dost thou turn
‘Thy rapid march, when to iberian fights

‘The war commende thee? Weight nor power have we
‘To away the mighty condicta of the world. 390

‘ We boast no victorias sinoe our fatherland

‘ We left in exile: when Phoooea's fort

‘ Perished in flames, we sought another here;

‘ And here on foreign shores, in narrow bounds

‘ Confined and saie, our boast is sturdy faith;

‘ Nought else. But if our city to blocknde

‘ J avelin and blazing torch upon our homes-

‘ Do what thou wilt: cut off the source that fills

‘ Our foaming river, force us, prone in thirsi, roo
‘ To dig the earth and lap the soanty pool;

‘ Seiae on our corn and leave us food abhomed ε

‘ This people shall not rhun, for freedom's sake,

‘ The ills Saguntum bore in Punic siege ;¹

ιΤοτη, vainly clinging, from the shrimken breast

‘ The siarving babe shall perish in the flames.

‘ Wives at their husbands' hands shall pray their fate,
‘ And brothers' weapons deal a mutual death.

‘ Such be our civil war; not, Coesar, thine'
