‘lf freedom ever oould for penoe be sold,
‘And fame uusoiled: 'tis true our foes ere ewom

‘To cur-sed crime: should you whose onuse is just,
‘And who mey hope for perdon in defeat, .
‘Hold cheep your honour? Sheme upon your peaoe!

Comes back upon them till they hardly spere
Their keeper. 'Ihus they rush ou every crime :
And blows which dealt in blinduaee of affray
Might seem the crimes of chenoe, or of the gode

Made monstrous, horrid. Where they letely spread
'l'he mutual ooueh end bouquet, eud embrnoed
Some new-found friend, now falls the fatal blow
Upon the sels-some breuem und though et first
Groening at the fell chanoe, they drew the swoni3
Hele risen as they atrike, the murderous erm
Confirme the doubtful will ε in dreadful joy
Through the wild oemp they smote their kinemeu down ;
And minage reged uncheoked3 und each men struve,
Proud of his crime, before hie leader's fuce 29⁰
To prove his shemelessuaee of guilt.

But thou,

Cesar, though losing of thy best, dost know
