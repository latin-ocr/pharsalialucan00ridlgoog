PHARSALIA '3001 111

And rent in twain he hnng; nor slowly flowed
Aa from a wound the blood ς but all his veins¹
Were torn asunder and the stream of life tto
Gushed o'er his limbs till lost amid the waves.

With flesh commingled; and the brazen beaks

Rolled, nor could bear their weight, the ruthless crew
Hacked off their straining arms3 then maimed they sant
Below the seething naves, to rise no more.
Now every dart was hurled and every spear,
The soldier weaponlessz yet their tage found arms :
