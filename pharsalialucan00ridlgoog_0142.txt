Boon 1v STORY OF ANTAEUS lla

‘Both land and sea of monsters. Down on earth

‘ He threw his mantle of the lion’s skin

‘Slain in Cleone; nor Antaens less

‘Cast down the hide he wore. With shining oil,

‘As one who wrestles at Olympia's feast,

‘The hero rubbed his limbs: the giant feamd oso
‘Lest standing only on his parent earth

‘His strength might fail; and cast o'er all his bulk
‘Hot saud in handfuls. Thus with arms entwined
‘And gmppling hands each seizes on his ioe;

‘With hardened muscles straining at the neck·

‘Long time in vain3 sor firm the sinewy throat
‘Stood column-like, nor yielded; so that each
‘Wondered to find his peer. Norat the first

‘Divine Alcides put forth all his strength,

‘By lengthy struggle wearing out his foe, too
‘Till chilly drops stood on Antaeus' limbs,

‘And toppled to its fall the stately throat‚

‘And smitten by the hero's blows, the legs

‘Begnn to totter. Breast to breast they strive

‘To gain the vantage, till the victor's arms

‘Gini in the giant's yielding back and sides,

‘And squeeze his middle part: next 'twixt the thighs
‘He puts his feet, and forcing them spart,

‘Lays low the mighty monster limb by limb.

‘The dry earth drank his sweat, while in his veins 710
‘Warm ran the life-blood, and with strength refreshed,
‘The muscles swelled and all the joints grew firm,
‘And with his might restored, he breaks his bonds
‘And rives the arms of Hercules away.

‘Amazed the hero stood at such a strength.

‘Not thus he feared, though then unused to war,
‘That hydra fierce which, smitten in the marsh

‘of Inachus, renewed its severed heads.
