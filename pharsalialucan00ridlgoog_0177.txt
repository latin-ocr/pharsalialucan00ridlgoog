‘Known to the Roman stete my neme shall bear.
‘Let none know this but thou who heer'st my preyens,
‘Fortunet thet Coeser summoned tn the ehadec,

‘ Dictator, Consul, full of honours, died

‘Ere his last prize was won. 1 usk no pyre 770
‘Or tomb, ye gods! wherein my dust mey rest:
‘Nay! plunge in middle deep this bettered freme!
‘All earth shall look forme, nor shnll men oense

‘At Ceeeer's neme to sear? Such words he spelte,
When lo! a tenth gigantic billow raised

The feeble keel, end where between the rocks

A cleft geve sefety, placed it on the shore.

Thus in a moment fortune, kingdom, lends,

Once more were Caeser's.

But on his return ι

When deylight came, he entered not the camp 780
Silent as when he perted; for his friends

Soon preseed around him, end with weeping eyes

ln occentu welcome to his eers began : -
‘Whither in reckless during hest thou gone,
‘Unpitying Caeser? Were these humble lives

‘Lei't here unguerded while thy limbe were given,
‘Unsought for, to be scettered by the sturm ?

‘When on thy breeth so many natione hung

‘For lise and sefety, end so great a world

‘Calls thee its mester, to have courted death 790
‘Proves want of beart. Were none of 011 thy friends
‘Deserving held to join their sete with thine?

‘When thou west toesed upon the stormy mein

‘We lay in slumber! Sbame upon such sleep!

‘And why thyeelf didst eeek Italia'e shores?
‘'l'were cruel (euch thy thought) to speak the word

‘Thet bede another dare the furious eeu.

‘All men must beer what chance or sete may bring,
‘The sudden peril end the stroke of death ;
