Boou 111 MASSILIA 67

Gave up the treasure which sor centurias 180
No hand had touched: all that the Punic foe

And Perses and Philippus conquered gave,

And all the gold which Pyrrhus panic·struck

Lest when he ssed: that gold,¹ the price os Rome,
Which yet Fabricius sold not, aud the hoeni

Laid up by saving sires ; the tribute sent

By Asia's richest nations; and the wealth

Which conquering Metellus brought from Crete,

And Cato² bore from distant Cyprus home;

And lest, the siches torn from captive kings rso
And borne before Pompeius when he came

ln frequent triumph. Thus was robbed the shrine,
And Caesar first brought poverty to Rome.

Meanwhile all nations of the earth were moved

Το share in Magnus' fortunas and the war,

And in his fated ruin. Groecia sent,

Nearest of all, her succours to the host.

From Cirrha and Pamessus' double peak

And from Amphissa, Phocis sent her youth:

Fnom swist Cephisus' fate-declariug stream, 200
And 'lheban Dirce, chiefs lioeotian came :

All Pisa mustered and Alpheus youths,
⁸Alphius who in far Sicilian lands

Beyond the billows seeks the day again:

Arcadian Maenalus, and OEta loved

By Hercules, and old Dodona's oaks

Are lest to silence ; l'or the sacred train

¹ Thalia. tha gold offered by Pyrrhus, and refused by Fabricius, which,
aiter the final deioet ol Pyrrhus, came luto the possession oi the victore.

² See Plutarch, ‘Oeta’ 34, 39.

⁸ It was generally believed that the river Alpheus of the Peloponnesus
passed under thesea audreappeared in the lomtain of Mathoae at Syracuse.
Α goblet was said to have been thrown luto the river in Graece, aud to
have reappeared in the Siciliae fountain. See the note in Grote's ‘History
oi Graece' Edition 1862, vol li, p. 8.
