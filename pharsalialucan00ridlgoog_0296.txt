‘ ‘⁶ Cato, none else ! ” Thus heve 1 kept the ssith;
‘ Thy plot¹ prevailed upon me, und 1 lived
‘ 'lhy msudste to discharge. Now through the void
⁴ Of space, and shsdes of Bell, if such there be,
‘ 1 follow ; yet how distant be my doom
‘ 1 know not: first my spirit must endure
‘ The punishment of life, which saw thine end
‘ And could surtive it; sighs shall breok my beart,
‘ Teors shall dissolve it ε sword nor noose 1 need iso
‘ Nor headlong plunge. Twere shameful since thy death,
⁴ 'Were ought but grief required to couse my own?
She seeks theosebio, veiled, in funeral gerb,
Iu team to find her soloce, ond to love
Grief in her husbond's room; uo tempest how]

Among the shrouds, no ongered voves aroused
Her soul, nor cry of sailors in dismay:
For lise their prayers3 not hers: ond prone she lies

Resigned to death and welcomiug the storm.
First reached they Cyprus on the ioomy brine; iso

Then ss the eastern breece more gently held

The favouriug deep, they touched the Libyen shore

Where stood the camp of Coto. Sod us one

Who deep iu seor prosoges ilis to come,

Cnaeus beheld his brother oud his band

of patriot oomrodss. Switt into the wove

He leaped oud cried‚ ‘Where‚ brother, is our sire?
‘ Stil] stands our country mistress of the world,
‘ Or are we fallen, Rome with Magnus' death
