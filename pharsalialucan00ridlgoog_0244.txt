1³00an THE Bnmu 215

When peoples fell. Thus, Rome, thy doom ivus wrought
At diead Pharsalus. Not, os in other holds,
By soldieis slain, or oaptains3 here were swept
Whole natious to the death ; Assyria hene,
Achaia, Pontus; and the blood of Rome
Gushing iu tonents forth, forbade the ros-t
'l‘o stagnate on the plain. Nor life was nell, uo
Nor safety only then; but neeled the world
And all her manifold peoples at the blow
In that dny's battle dealt; nor only then
Felt, but in all the times that were to oome.
Those swords gave seiwitude to every age
That shall be slavish; by our sines was shaped
For us our destiny‚ the despot yoke.
Yet have we trembled not, nor feaied to baio
Our throats to daughter, nol· to sace the foe:
We bear the penalty for otheis' shnme‚ loo
Such be our doom; yet, F ortune‚ shariug not
In that last battle, 'twas our right to strike
One blow sor heedom ere we served our lord.
Now saw Pompeius, gn‘eving‚ that the gods
Hud left his side, and knew the fatos of Rome
l‘assed fnum his governance; yet all the blood
'lhat filled the field scanne brought him to consess
His fortunas fled. Α little hill be sought
Whenee to descry the battle raging still
Upon the plain, which when he nemer stood too
The warring ranks concealed. Thenoe did the chief ’
Gaze on imnumbered swords that llashed in air
And sought his ruin; and the tide of blood
In which his host bad perished. Yet not as those
Who, prostrate fallen, would drag nations down
To share their evil sate, Pompeius did.
Still were the gods thought worthy ol his prnyers
