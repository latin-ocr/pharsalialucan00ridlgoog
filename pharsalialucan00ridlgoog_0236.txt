And shall Pharsalus' mom, darkest of 011,

Stand on the page unmerlred? Ales, 0110101001 4110
Not plague nor pestilenoe nor famine's rage,

Not cities given to 111011011οε, nor towns

Trembling 01 0110011 of earthqualre shall weigh down
Such heroes lost, when Fortune's ruthless hand

Lops at one blow the gist of oenturies,

leaders and men embettled. How great art thou,
Rome, in thy fall! Stretohed to the wideat bounds
Wer upon wer laid natione et thy feet

Til] flaming Titan nigh to either pole

Beheld thine empire; and the hrrthest east ⁶0⁰
Was almost thine‚ till day end night and sky

For thee revolved‚ and all the 00010 could see
Throughout their course was Roman. But the 10100

111 one dread day of slaughler and despair

Tumed beck the centurias and spoke thy doom.

And now the Indian seara the axe 110 more

Once emblem of thy power, now no more

The girded Consul curba 1110 Getan horde‚

Or in Sarmatian furrows guides the share :¹

Still Parthia boests her triumpha unavenged : 010
Foul is the public life; end Freedom, fled

To furthest Earth beyond the Tigris stream,

And Rhine's broad river, wandering at her will

'Mid Teuton hordes and Scythium, though by sword
Sought, yet returns 1101. Would that from the day
When Romulus, eided by the vulture's ssight,
Ill-omened‚ raised within that hateful grove

Rome's earliest walls, down to the crimsoned field
ln dire Thessalia fought, she ne'er bad known
