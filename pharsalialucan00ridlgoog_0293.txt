PHARSALIA 3001 rx

Tossed on the deep: in Brutus' blameless breast
Terried awhile, and roused his angered soul
To resp the vengeance; lust possessed the mind
of huughty Cato.
’ He while yet the scales
Were poised and balanced, nor the war hsd given
The world iis mester, hated both the chiefs‚
But followed Magnus for the Senate's cause
And for his country: now in all his heart su
Wes bound to Magnus, since Pharsalia's field.
Shorn of her guardian his counhry found
In him her guide3 the people's trembling limbs
He cherished with new hope, and weapons gave Ι
Back to the eraven hands that cast thern forth.
Nor yet for empire did he wege the war
Nor fearing slavery: nor in arms schieved
Aught' for himself: freedom, since Magnus fell,
The sim of ull his host. And lest the foe
ln repid course triumphant should collect eo
His seetuered bonds, he sought Corsyre's gulis
Conoealed, and bore in thousand ships away
The fragments of the min wrought in Thrae.
Who in such mighty nevy had believed
A host defeated sailed upon the main
Thronging the sea with keels? Round Malea's cape
And Taenems open to the shades below
And fair Cythera's isle, th' sdvencing {leet
Sweeps o'er the yielding weve‚ by northern breeze
Borne past the Cretan shores. But Phycus dared oo
Refuse her hurbour, and th' evenging hand
Left her in ruins. Thus with gentle eirs
They glide along the main and resch the shore
From Palinurus ¹ named ; lor not alone
A promontory in Ainos was so called, ns well ss thot in Italy.
