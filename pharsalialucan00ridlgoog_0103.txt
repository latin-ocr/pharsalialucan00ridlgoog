PHARSALIA Booxlss

ln golden filleu, Arimaspiene come,
And fieroe Messagetae, who queff the blood
Oi the breve steed on which they fight eud flee.

Not when great Cyrus on Memnonieu reelms
His werriors poured3 nor when, their weepons piled,¹
The Persian told the number oi his host; 3³⁰
Nor when th' avenger² of a brother's shume ,
Louded the billows with his mighty lieet,
Beneaih one chief so many kinge mede wer;
Nor e'er met notione varied ibus in gerb
Andibus in lenguage. To Pompeius' death
Thus Fortune oelled them: end e world in ernis
Witneesed his ruin. From where Afric's god,
Twohorned Ammon, reers his temple, oeme
All Libye ceeueless, from the wostee that touch
The bounds of Egypt to the shore thet meets 3⁴⁰
The Weeiern Ooean. Thus, to ewerd the prize

Of Empire ei one blow, Pharsalia brought

'Neeth Caeeer's conquering hund the bended world.
Now Caeear lest the wells of trembliug Rome

And swift across the cloudy Alpine tops

He winged his march3 but while eil others fled

Fer from his path, iu tenor of his nume,
