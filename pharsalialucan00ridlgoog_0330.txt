Boon IX CATO

Ere‘rode his barks on waters aafe from atonn.
Then Caesar aaw that tumult held the shore,
And mingled voices of unoertain sound
Struck on hia ear: and trusting not himself
To doubtful kingdom, of uncertain tmth,
He kept his ahips from land. But from the king
Came his vile minion forth upon the wave, 1200
Bearing his dseadftd gia, Pompeius' head,
Wrapped in a coven'ng of Phadan wool.
First took he speech and thus in ahameleas worda
Commendo the murder: ‘Conqueror of the world,
6 Firat of the Roman race, and, what aa yet
‘ Thou dost not know, sale by thy kinaman alaim
‘Thia gist reoeive from the Pellaean king,
6 Sole tmphy absent from the ThMian field,
6 Το orown thy toils on land and on the deep.
6 Here in thine abaenoe have we placed for thee 1210
‘ An end upon the war. Hem Magnus oame
‘ To mend his fallen fortunes; on our awonds
6 Here met hia death. With such a pledge of faith
‘ Hene have we bought thee, Caeaar3 with his blood
6 Seal we this treaty. Take the Pharian malm
6 Sought by no bloodshed‚ take the mle of Nile,
‘ Take all that thou wouldst give for Magnue’ life:
‘ And hold him vaaaal worthy of thy camp
‘ To whom the fatas against thy son-inlaw
‘ Such power entnnted ; nor hold thou the dead 1220
6 Lightly aooompliahed by the awordsman's ahake,
6 And so the merit. Gueat ancestral he
‘ Who was ita viatim ; who, hia aiae expelled,
‘ Gave back to him the soephe. For a deod
6 So great, thou'lt find a name-or ask the world.
6 Il' 'twas a crime, thou must confess the debt
‘ To us the gneater, for that from thy hand
6 We took the doing?
