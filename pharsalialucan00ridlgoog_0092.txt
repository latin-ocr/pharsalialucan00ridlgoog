Wms canvas yielding tn tha southern wind
The navy sailed the deep, and every eye
Gazed on Ionian billows. But the chief

'lhrned not his vision fmm his native shore
Now left for ever, while the morning mists
Drew down upon the mountains‚ and the cliffs
Faded in distance till his aching sight

No longer knew them. Then his wearied frame
Sank in the arms of sleep. But J ulia's shape,

In mournful guise, dread horror on her brow, ιο
Rose through the gaping earth, and from her tomb
Erect‚l inform as os a Fury spake:

‘Dn'ven from Elysian helds and from the plains

‘The blast inhabit‚ when the war began,

‘I dwell in Stygian darkness where abide

‘'Ihc souls os all the guilty. 'lhere 1 saw

‘Th' Eumenides with tnrches in their hands

‘Prepared against thy battlss; and tha fleets¹

⁴ Which by the fenyman of the flaming stream

‘Were made to bear thy dead: and Hell enlarged 2⁰
‘To hold thy punishments : the sisters three

¹ So ‘The rugged Charon iamed,
And askad a nav, rather than a boat,
Το serry over the sad world that came!

(Ben Jonscn, ‘catilina' Act t, scena 1.)
