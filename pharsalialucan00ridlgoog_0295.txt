PHARSALIA

⁶ Dost thou not, impious, upon thy heart

⁶ Pompeius' image, and upon thy soul

⁶ Bear ineffaoeable? Dust closed in urns so
⁶ Is for the wife who would survive her lord,

⁶ Not such as thee, Cornelia! And yet

⁶ Yon scanty light that glimmers from afar

⁶ Upon the Pharian shore, somewhat of thee

⁶ Reoalls, Pompeius! Now the ilame sinks down

⁶ And smoke drifts up across the eastern sky

⁶ Bearing thine ashes, and the rising wind

⁶ Sighs hateful in the sail. To me no more

⁶ Dearer than this whatever land has given

⁶ Pompeius victory, nor the frequent oar roo
⁶ 'lhat carried him in triumph to the hill;

⁶ Gone is that happy husband from my thoughts;

⁶ Here did 1 lose the hero whom 1 knew ;
⁶ Here let me stay ; his presenoe shall endear

⁶ The sends of Nile where fell the fatal blow.

⁶ 'lhou‚ Sextus, brave the chanoes of the war

⁶ And bear Pompeius' standard through the world.

⁶ For thus thy father spalse within mine ear:

⁶ ‘⁶ When sounds my fatal hour let both my sons

⁶ ⁶⁶ Urge on the war; nor let some Coesar find 110
⁶ ⁶⁶ Room for an empim, while shall live on earth

⁶ ⁶⁶ Still one in whom Pompeius' blood shall run.

⁶ ⁶⁶ This your appointed tsslr3 all cities strong

⁶ ⁶⁶ In freedom of their own, all kingdoms urge

⁶ ⁶⁶ To join the sombat: ior Pompeius calls.

⁶ ⁶⁶ Nor shall a chieftain of that faumus name

⁶ ⁶⁶ Ride on the sess and fail to find a ileet.

⁶ ⁶⁶ Urged by his sire's unconquerable will

⁶ ⁶⁶ And mindsul ol his rights, mine heir shall ronse

⁶ ⁶⁶ All nations to the condiet. One alone, 120
⁶ ⁶⁶ (Should he contend for ‘freedom) may ye servm
