Βοοι Vl SCAEVA'S EXPLOI'I'S 161

‘ Not to be found where sloughtered heroes lie?
‘ Is loyolty too weak? Yet love of fight
‘ Might bid you stand. We are the chosen few

‘ Through whom the soe would break. Unbought by blood
‘ This day shall not be theirs. 'Neath Caeear's eye,

‘ True, death would be more hsppy3 but this boon

‘ Fortune denies: at least my fall shall be

‘ Praised by Pompeius. Shotter with your breasts

‘ 'Iheir weopons3 blunt the edges oi their swords tuo
‘ With throats unyielding. In the distant lines

‘ The dost is seen already, and the sound

‘ of tumult and oi ruin finds the eur

‘ Of Caesar: strike; the victory is ours:

‘ For he shall come who while his soldiers die

‘ shall make the iortress his' His voice cells forth

The couroge that the trumpets failed to rouse

When first they rung: his oommdes mustering come
To wotch his deeds; end, wondering ut the man,

To testis volour thus by foes oppressed, 2⁰⁰
In nerrow space, could hope ior ought but death.

But Scaevo standing on the tottering bank

Heeves from the brimming turret on the foe

The corpses of the fallen 3 the ruined mess

Gives weapons to his hunds; with beams ond poles
And ponderous stones, with his own breast he threots
His enemies; ond thrusts with mighty stokes

The host advancing3 when they grosp the wall

He lops the orm: rocks crush the soeman's skull

And rive the sculp usunder: dery bolts 210
Dashed ot another set his hair adame,

Till rolls the greedy blane about his eyes

With hideous crsckle. As the pile of sluin

Rose to the summit of the wall he sprung,

Swift as across the nets a hunted purd,
