Βοοι vl DYRRHACHIUM 157

Nor room io movebis camp3 noy, rivers rose

within, and ran their course and reached the sea;
And Caesar wem-led ere he saw the whole,

And daylighi failed him. Let the ancient tale
Attribute to the labours of the gods
The walls of Ilium: lei ibe fragile bricks
Which composa in great Babylon, amane so
The fleeting Parthian. Here a larger space
'l'han those great citios which Orontes swist
And Tigris' stream enclose, or that which boasts
ln Eastem elimes, the lordly palaces
Fit for Assyria's kings, is closed by walls
Amid ihe haste and tumult of a war
Fomed to completion. Yet this labour huge
Was spent in vain. So many hands had joined
Or Sestos with Abydos, or had iamed
With mighty mole the Hellespontine ware, 70
(lr Corinth from the realm of Pelops king
Had rent asunder‚ or had spsred each ship
Her voyage round the long Malean cape,
Or had done anyihing mosi hard, ln mould
'lhe world's oeated surface. Here the war
Was prisoned: blood predestinate ho flow
ln all the parts of earth: the host foredoomed
To fall in Libya or in Thessaly
Was here: in such small amphitheatra
The tide of civil passion rose and fell.

At first Pompeius knew not: so the hind
Who peaceful tills the mid-Sicilian fields
Hears not Pelorus ¹ sounding to the storin ;
So billows thunder on Rutupian shores,¹

Unheard by distant Caledonia's tribes.
Bul when he saw the mighiy banier stretch

¹ C. dcl Fato, the hs. point of Sicily. ¹ The shores of Kent.
