Βοοι Vl THE ercH OF THESSALIA 175

Gliding serene upon her nightly eouree

Ie ehorn of lustre by their poisonoue chent,

Dimmed by dark enrthly fires, ee though our orb

Shedowed her brother'e radianoe end herred

The light bestowed by heaven ς nor freehly ehinee eoo

Until deseending neerer to the earth

She eheds her beneful drope upon the mend.
These einful ritee and these her sierer's eonge

Abhorred Erichtho, fiereeet of the rece,

Spumed for their piety, end yet viler ert

Prectieed in novel form. To her no home

Beneeth a ehelrering roos—her direful heed
Thus to lay down were crime τ deserted tombs

Her dwelling·plaee‚ from which, derling of hell,

She dragged the dead. Nor life nor gods sorbed ero
But that ehe knew the secret homes of Styx

And learned to heer the whispered voice of ghoete

At dread mysterioue meetings.¹ Never eun

Shed his pure light upon that heggerd cheek

Pele with the pallor of the ehadee, nor looked

Upon those locks unkenrpt that crowned her bron.
In sterlese nighte of tempest crept the hag

0ut from her tornb to eeize the levin bolt;
Treeding the harvest with eccureed foot

She burned the fruitful growth and with her breeth 620
Poieoned the eir else pure. No prayer she brenthed
Nor euppheation to the gode, nor knew

The pulee of entreils: logs from fleming pyren

She loves to eest on altere of the gods,

And incense pilfered from the smoking hornb.
