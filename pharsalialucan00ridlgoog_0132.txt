1³00=1v cAESAR IN SPAIN. 103

The reeking filth of ahambles io the stream, 300
And heobane dire and all the poisonous herbs
That lurk on Cretan slopes, still had they drunh
The fatal walers, rather than endure
Such lingen'ng agony. Their bowels raoked
with lorments as of flame3 the awollen longua
And jans now parched and n'gid, and the veins;
Eaeh laboured breath with anguish from the lungs
Enfeebled, moistureleas‚ is scaroely drawn,
And aoaroe again returned3 and yet agape,
Their panting mouths suck in the nightly dew3 370
'Ihey walch sor ahowers from heaven, and in despair
Gaze on the clouds, whenoe lately poured a flood.
Nor were their bortmes less that Meroe
San not their sufferings, nor Canoer's zone,
Nor where the Garamantian turns the soil;
But Sicoris and Iberus at their feet,
Two mighty floods‚ but far beyond their reach,
Rolled down in measureless volume οο the main.
But now their leaders yield; Afranius,
Vanquished, throws down his arms, and leads his
troops, 330
Now hardly lin'ng, lo the hostile oamp
Before the victor's feet, and sues for peaoe.
Proud is his bearing, and despite of ills,
His mien majestia of his triumphs past
Still mindful in disaster-thus he stands,
Though suppliant for graoe, a leader yet3
From fearless beart thus speaking: ‘Had the lates
‘Thrown me before sorne base ignoble soe,
‘Nol, Coesar, thee3 still had this arm fought on
‘ And snaohed my death. Now if 1 suppliant ask, 330
‘ 'ris that 1 value still the boon of life
‘ Given hya worthy hand. No party ties
