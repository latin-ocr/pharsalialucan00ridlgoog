PREFACE TO THE FlRST EDITION xvii

readers is unoouth ond almost repulsive. He keeps, generally
speaking, fairly close to the original, yet shrinlrs from some
ol the passages, particularly from those which ere hsnler snd

more abstruse. Iwill give some short anesis illustretise ol
my meenmg:

'lhere filled with true light, with wond'n'ng eyes

The wond'ring plonets end first stass he sees.

lle sees our dny involv’d in midst of night,

And loughs et his tome trunk‘s ridiculous pugne
Book 1x. line 12.

The ponderous earth out os her censer tost,
Her middle ploce in the world‘s orbe hss lost ;
So great s weight strooke by that voice wss stirr'd

And on both sides the foce of heaven appeared.
Book lV. line 481.

But his version of Celo's speech ot the oracle of Hammon,
Book IX. lines 566-584 (660-685 in this translation), will
probably find admirers, and is ss follows:

What, Labienus, should l seeke lo know?
1f l hod rather dye in armes, than bow
Unto a Lord? if life be nought st all l

No differenoe hetwixt long lile and small?
ll any force con hurt men vertuous?

ll fortune loose, when vertue doth oppose
Her threats, if good desires be happinesse
And vestus grow not greater by successe?

Thus much we know, nor deeper csn the skill
OfAmmontesch. Thegodssrewithusstilh

And though their orscles should silent he,

Nought cen we doe without the gods deorse ;

Nor needs he voices 3 what vos fit to know

The great Creator st our births did show.

Nor did he ehoose these barren sends to shew
(Hiding it heere) his trueth but to s few.

ls there s seooe ol God, seve esrth, end ses,

Aine, heaven, end sertus? Why sor God should we

Seeke further? tht ere moves, whst ere is sesne
