PHARSALIA 1300. w

y‘ Insected‚ so that Ceres fem from hell
‘ To oall her daughter. And for thee, base king, oso
‘Titan shall pieroe thy oeverns with hie mys
‘ And sudden day shall emite thee. Do ye hear?
‘ Or shall 1 summon to mine eid thot god
‘ At whose dsead nome earth trembles ; who oon look
‘ Unflinching on the Gorgon's head, and drive
‘The Furies with his soourge, who holds the deptho
⁴ Ye cannot sethum, and above whose heunts
‘ Ye dwell supernah who by waveo of Styx
‘ Forsweors himself unpunished ?'
Then the blood
Giew worm end liquid, end with softening touch ooo
Cherished the stiffened wounds ond filled the mino,
Till throbbed onoe more the slow returning pulse
And every iibre trembled‚ as with death
Life was commingled. Then, not limb by limb,
With toil and strain, but rising ot o bound
leoped from the eaxth emet the living mon.
Fierce glaoed his eyes uncovemd, and the life
Was dim, ond still upon his face remained
The pallid hues of hondly partod death.
Amozement seioed upon him, to the earth ooo
Brought beck again ε hut from his lips tight drawn
No murmur issued; he had power alone
When questioned to reply. ‘Speok,' quoth the hog,
. ‘Aslshallhidthee3 greotshallbethygoin

‘ lf true thine answers‚ freed for evermore

‘ From all Haemonian ert. Such burin] ploce

⁸ Shall now be thino and on thy funere] pyie

‘ Such fatal woodo shall bum, euch chent shall sound,
‘Thet to thy ghost no mole or magio song

‘ Or spell shall reach, and thy Iethaeon sleep olo
‘ shall never more be broken in o death
