PHARSALIA 1³00- vi

O'er hill end vulley‚ and enclose the land,

He bade his columns leave their rocky hold
And seize on posis of vaninge in the plain 3
'ihus forcing Caesur io extend his troops

On wider lines; and holding lor his own

Such space encompossed as divides from Rome
Aricia,l sacred to that goddess chosie

0s old Mycenae; or as Tiber holds

From Rome's high rumperis to the Tuscun seo,
Unless he devicte. No irumpei call
Commonds an onsei‚ and the duris thui ily

F ly ihough forbidden ; bui the orm thoi flinge
For proof the lance, at modom, here end there
Deelo impious sluughter. Weighiy core compelled loo
Eech leuder to withhold his troops from light;
For there ihe weory earth ol produce failed
Pressed by Pompeius' smodi, whose horny hools

liung in their gullop on the grcscy fields
And killed ihe succulence. They strengthlceo loy
Upon the mown expense, nor pile of siren,

Broughi imm full berns in pluce of living grass,
llelieved their oruving3 shoolr their ponting fiunis,
And as ihey wheeled Deoih struck his victim down.
Theo foul ooniegion iilled the murky air iro
Whose poisonous weight pressed on thern in o cloud
Pestiferous; os in Nesis’ isle ² the breath

Oi Styx rolls upwards from the misi-clad rocks;

0r that iell vapour which the caves exhale

From Typhon³ raging in the depths below.
