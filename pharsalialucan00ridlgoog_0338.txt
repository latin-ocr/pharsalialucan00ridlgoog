Boon x CAESAR IN EGYPT

But towards the rising of the sun, we yield

Το him who kept the Arsacida in awe;

And puny Pella held as provinoe aure

Now from the atteam Pelusian oi the Nile,

Was oome the boyish king, taming the rage

Within the Macedonian paleae gates,

Coeaar unknowing‚ entered: Egypt'a shame;

Fury oi Latium ς to the bane of Rome

By fatal beauty Argos urged to atrise

And Ilium's homes, so Cleopatra rouaed

Seined on her soul upon that night in which

Antonius ior the madneaa of hia love,

When Coeaar's haughty breaat drew in the dame?

Who red with earnage‚ 'mid the olaah of arma,
