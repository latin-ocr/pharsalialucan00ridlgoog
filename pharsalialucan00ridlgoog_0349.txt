‘ With rush of waters3 and with sounding roer
4 The looming mass down from the summit poure
‘ In honry waves victorious. Next cn isle 000
4 In cll our ancient lore 44 untrodden ” named
4 Stems firm thy torrent; and the rocks we call
‘ Springs ol the river, for that here are marked
4 The earliest tokens ol the coming flood
4 With mountain shores now nature hemo thee in
‘And shuts thy naves from Libya; in the midst
‘ Hence do thy waters run, till Memphis first
4 Forbids the bernier placed upon thy stream
4 And gives thee necess to the open iields?
Thus did they pass, as though in peace profound, 400
The nightly watches But Pothinus' mind,
Once with accursed butchery imbued,
Was irenzied still ; since great Pompeius fell
No deed to him was crime ; his rabid soul
Th' avenging goddesses and Magnus' shude
Stirred to fresh horrors; and a Pherion hund
No less was worthy, as he deemed‚ to shed
'that blood which Fortune purposed should bedew
The conquered fathers: and the fell revenge
Due to the senate lor the civil war ⁴1⁰
This hireling almost snatched. Avert, ye fater,
Far hence the shame that not by Brutus' hand
This blow be struck ! Shall thus the tyrant's fell,
Just at our hands, become a Phorian crime.
Rest of example? To prepare a plan
(Fated to fail) he darem nor veils in houd

A plot for murder, but with open war

Attecks th' unoonquered chieftain : from his crimes

He gained such courage as to send command

To lop the head of Coesor, and to join ⁴20
ln death the kinsmen chiefs.
