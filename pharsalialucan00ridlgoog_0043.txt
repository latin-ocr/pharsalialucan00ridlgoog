The soil of Italy's forbidden fields,

‘ Here,' spoke he, ‘ peuce, here broken lows be lest3

‘ Farewell to trestioe. Fortune, lead me ους

‘ Wer is our judge, eud in the setes our trust'
Then in the shsdes oi night he lesds the troops eoo
Swister than Balearic sling or shaft
Winged by retresting Parthian, to the wells
0f threatened Rimiui, while fled the stars,

⁴ Save Lucifer, before the ooming sun,
Whose firee were veiled in clouds, by south wind driven,
Or else at heaven's commend: end thus drew on
The first durk morning os the civil warh,
Now stood the troops within the captured town,

Their standerds planted ς und the trumpet clang
Rung forth in hursh alumnis, giving note 27⁰
Oi impious strife: roused from their sleep the men
Rushed to the hell end snetched the ancient arms
Long hnnging through the years os peeoe ; the shield
With crumbliug fromer dark with the tooth of rust
Their swords ; ¹ and jevelino with blunted point.
But when the well-known signs ond eagles shone,
And Caesar towering o'er the throng was seen,

They shook for terror, sear possessed their limbs,
And thoughts unuttered stirred within their souls.
‘ Ο misereble those to whom their home 280
‘ Denies the peeoe thet all men else enjoy!
‘ Pleced ss we are beside the Northern bounds
. ‘And soeroe e footstep from the restless Gaul,
‘ We sall the first; would that our lot hod been

‘ Beneath the Eestem sky, or frooen North,
‘ To leod e wondering life, rather than keep

¹ Herlowe bus it:
⁴ . . . And swords
with ugly tseth of bleolr rust toully soened!
