PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION xv

lor special praise the dream of Pompey iu Book v11.‚ aud the
enumeratiou of his exploits in Book VIII. ‘When Ι oon·
sider,’ he says, ‘that Lucan died at twenty-six, 1 cannot help
ranking him among the most extraordinary men that ever
lived? But before the days of Macaulay, Dante gave a place

characteristica, and says, with some justice, that he had not
really pictured to himself the sceneos the great battle which
was the centrepiece of his poem; he criticises truly the vagae
and uncertain philosophy of the poet, strongly stoica] and
yet undelined, and the frequent errors in his encyclopoedic
knowledge. One sentence may be quoted, iu which he says:
‘His wit and claremaus, considering his years, are pre-
ternatural: the trumpet tunes of his scorn or admiration,
after more thau thirty years' familiarity, still thuoder in
my ears with startling intensity.' For the rest I must con-
tent myself with referring to the close of the fifty-sixth and
the opening of the sixty·fourth chapter-s of his ‘History of the
Romans during the Empire.'

me hope for an indulgent triticism. Mr. Heitlaud, indeed,
