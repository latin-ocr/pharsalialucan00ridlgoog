soon vn THE BA'I'rLE

Were in his face, es for the woes ol Rome.
No pride in him the day ol victory found,
Nor rout shall find despair 3 alike in days ooo
When liekle F ortune triple triumph gave
And when she fled, her lord.
The burden loid
Os thine impending inte, thou pertesi free
To muse upon the happy days of yore.
Hope now hes lled; but in the fleeting post
How west thou great! Seelr thou the wass no more,
And cell the gods to witness thet for thee
Henoeforth no men shall die. The fights to come
On Afric's moumful shore, by Pharos* stream
And seteful Mundo, end the final soene oio
Os dire Pharsalia's battle ere not thine.
Thy neme no more shall stir the world to wer,
But those great rivals biding with us yet,
Caeser end Liberty; end not for thee
When thou hedst fled the field, but for itseli
The dying &note still upheld the light.
’ Find'st thou not soloce thus to quit the field
Nor witness all the horrors of its close?
Look beck upon the orimsoned ranks of wer,
'lhe rivers turbid with ensenguined stream ooo
'l'hen pity thou thy kinsmen. How shall he
Enter the city, who on such e field
Finds happiness? Whnte'er in lends unknown
Thine exiled lot, whate'er the Pherien king
May place upon thoe, trust thou in the gods 3

'l'rust the long story of the sevouring fetes:
'Twere worse to oonquer. Then forbid the teor,
'l'he oetion's grief, the weeping of mankind,
And let the world adore thee in defeat

Qmphs. With unaltered gaze ooo
