110 PHARSALIA Boon 1v

Were shortened by the Archer. ,
When day broke,

¹ Io! on the rocks the Istrians; while the sea

Swarmed with the gelieys and their Greeian fleet

All armed for fight: but first the war was stayed

And terme proposed: life to the foe they thought
Would seem the sweeter, by delay of death

Thus granted. But the band devoted stood,

Proud of their promised end, life all forsworn,

And careless of the fight: no jarriug note ooo
Opposed their high resolve. In numbers few

'Gainst foemen numberless by land and sea,

They wage the desperate war; then satiate

Turn from the foe. And first demanding death
Vulteius bared his throat. ‘What youth,' he ories,
‘Dares strike me down, and through his oeptain's wounds
‘Attest his love for death ?' Then through his side
Plunge blades uuoounted on the moment drawn.

He praises all : but him who struck the first

Grateful, with dying strength, he does to death. oro
They rush together, and without a foe

Work ail the guilt of battle. Thus of yore,

Rose up the glittering Dirooean band

From seed by Cadmus sowu, and fought and died,

Dire omen sor the brother kings of Thebes.

And so in Phasis’ fields the sons of earth,

Boni of the sleepless drogon, all inflamed

By magio incantatione, with their blood

Deluged the monstrous furrow, while the Queen

Feared at the spells she wmught. Devoted thus 62⁰

To death, they fail, yet in their death itself
Less valour show than in the fatal wounds

Empire: chapter xvi.
