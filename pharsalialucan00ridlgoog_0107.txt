Then did the Gnecian city win renown
Eternal, doathlaee ior that unoompelled
Nor iearing for herself, but free to act
She made the conqueror pause: and he who seized
All in iesistloes course found hem delay ε
And Portum, haetening to lay the world
Low at her favouriie's feet, was fomed to stay ⁴50
For these few momente her impatient hand.
Now fell the foresto iar and wide, deepoiled
of all their giant trunks: ior as the mound
On earth ond bruehwood stood, a timber frome
Held firm the soil, lest pressed beneath its towers
The mass might topple down. Theie stood a grove
Which from the earliest time no hand of man
Hnd dmed io violam hidden from the sun1
Its chill reooeees3 matied boughs entwined
Prisoned the air within. No sylvan nymphs 400
Here found a home, nor Pan, but sevege ritee

And barbamus worship, alters honible
On mossive stones upreered3 sacred with blood

Oi men was every tree. If saith be given
To ancient myih, no fowl hes ever dared

To resi upon those branches‚ and no beent

Has made his loir beneaih: no tempest fulls,

Nor lightnings flash upon it from the cloud.

stagnant the eir, unmming, yet the leaves

Filled with mysterious i1embling ς dripped the
streams 470

From coel-bleck founteins; effigies of gods

Rude‚ soaroely foshioned from some fallen tmnk

Held the mid speoe: and, poilid with deoay,

Their rotting shepes struck terror. Thus do men

Dread most the god unknown. Twas said that onves
