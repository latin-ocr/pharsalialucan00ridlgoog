‘ Hesperia when the wer hegen was mine ;
‘ Mine, hed 1 chosen in our country's shrines,

‘ ln midmost forum of her capital,

‘To join the battle. So lhnt banished fer sno
‘ Be wsr hum Rome, ΓΠ cross lhe horrid zone

⁶ 1 gave thee by my ssight? Rether lhnn thou

‘ Shouldst feel the evils of this impious wer,

‘ Let Caesnr deem thee his' He turned his course
Townrds the uprising sun, snd sought hy pnths
Remote, and loresls wide, the land by fale
Foredoomed to see the issue os the wer.

Thessalia on that side where Titan first seo
Rsises the wintry dsy, by Osss's rocks
Is prisoned in : hut in th* sdvancing year
When higher in the vnult his cheriot rides
'Tis Pelion that meets the morning rsys.
And when beside the Lion's flames he drives
The middle course, Othrys with woody lup
Screens his chief srdour. On lhe hither side
Pindus receives the hreenes of the west
And us the evening falls brings darkness in.
'lhere too Olympus, at whose loct who dwells suu
Nor feam the north nor sees the shining besr.
Between these mountains hemmed, in ancient time
The fields were maneb, for Tempe's pess not yet
Wss cleft, ho give en exit to the streame
Thnt filled the plain: bnt when Alcides' hand
Sinote Ossa from Olympus st s blow,¹
And Nereus wondered nt the sudden flood
0f walers ho the main, then on the shore
(W ould it hsd slept for ever 'nesth the deep)
