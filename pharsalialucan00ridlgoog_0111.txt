80 PHARSALIA Boon 111

The trees were knit together, and the deck
Gave steady foot-hold lor nn ocean light.
Meanwhile hsd Coesar's squadron lest the Rhone
And reached with Brutus'¹ turret ship the stmit ⁵80
By Stoechas’2 isles. Nor less the Grecian host—
Boys not yet grown to war, end aged men,
Armed for the conflict, with their all nt stake.
Nor only did they marshal for the flght
Ships meet for servioe; but their ancient keels
Brought from the dockycrds. When the morning rsys
Broke from the waters, end the sky wns clear,
And all the winds were still upon the deep,
Smoothed for the battle, swist on either part
The fleets esscy the open ; and the ships oso
Tremble beneeth the oars that urge them on,
By sinewy arms impelled. Upon the wings
That bound the Roman lieet, the longer eran
With triple and quadruple bcnks of osus
Giniinthelesser: sothey frontthcsec3
While in their rear, shaped ns a crescent moon,
Liburninn galleys follow. Over all
Towers Brutus' deck praetorinn. Ocrs on osus
Propel the bulky vessel through the main,
Six ranks3 the topmost strike the waves afar. ooo
When such a space remained between the fleets
As could be covered by c single stroke,
Innumerable voices rise in air
Drowning with resonant din the beot of oens
And note of trumpet summoning: and all
Sit on the benches and with mighty stroke
