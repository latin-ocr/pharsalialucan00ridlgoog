PHARSALIA soorvu -

Already flaming with the roge of war,

That each might bear his portion of the guilt

Which stained the host, unflinching through the ranks
Pcssed at his will. He looked upon the brands,

These roddenod only at the point, and those oso
Streaming with blood and gory to the hilt:

He marks the hand which trembling grssped the sword,
Or held it idle, and the cheek that grew

Pale at the blow, and that which at his words

Glowed with the joy of battle: midst the dead

lle tresde the plain and on each gaping wound

Presses his hand to keep the life within.

'l'hns caesar passed: and where his footsteps fell

As when Bellona shakes her crimson lash,

Or Mavors scourges on the Thracian mares¹ oso
When shunning the dread face on Pallas' shield‚

He driven his chariot, there arose a night

Dark with huge slaughtcr and with crime, and groans
As of a voioe immense, and sound of arms

As fell the wearer, and of swonl on sword

Crashed into fragments. With a ready hand

Caesar supplies the weapon and bids atrike

Full at the visagm and with lance reversed
Urges the flagging ranks and stirs the light.
Where flows the nation's blood, where beats the heart, oto
Knowing, he bids them spsre the common herd,
But soeks the senators-thus Rome he strikes,
Thus the last hold of Freedom. ln the frey,
Then fell the nobles with their mighty names
0f ancient prowess; there Metellus' sons,
Corvini, Lepidi, Torquati too,

Not onoc nor twice the conquerors of kings,

¹ 'first is, laches on his team terrified by tho Gorgon smold in tho
Μὴ ol the enemy.
