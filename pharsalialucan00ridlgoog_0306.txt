Boon 1x CATO

'Ihus ere they uod the deseris, Cato spnke:
‘ Ye men of Rome, who through mine arms alone ·
‘ Cun find the death ye oovet, and shall fell
‘ With pride unbroken should lhe fetes command,
6 Meet this your weighty mk, your high emprise
6 With heorts resolved to conquer. For we much

6 On sterile nastes, burnl regions of the world;

6 Scnroe are the wells, ond 'litun from the height

6 Burns pitheus, unclouded; end the slime

‘ Of poisonous serpente fouls the dusty earth. ⁴⁶⁰
6 Yet shall men venture for lhe love of laws

‘ And country perishing‚ upon the sends

6 Of troclless Libya; men who breve in soul

6 Rely not on the end, end in attempt

6 Will risle their all. *ris nol in Cato's thoughts

.‘ On this our enlerprise ho lead e bend

6 Blind to the truth, unuitling of lhe risk.

‘ Nay, give me comrades lor the denger's sele,

‘ Whom l shall see for honour end for Rome

6 Beer up against the worst. But whoso needs ⁴00
‘ A pledge os safety‚ to whom life is uweel,

6 let him by fairer joumey seek his lord.

‘ First be my foot upon the send3 on me

‘ First strike the buming sun ; across my poth

‘ The serpent void his venom3 by my fate

‘Know ye your perils. let him only thirsi

‘ Who sees me et the spring: who sees me seek

‘ The shnde, alone sink sainting in the heel3

‘ Or whoso sees me ride before the ranis

6 Plodding their weery mamb: such be the lot ⁴70
6 0f each, who, ioiling, finds in me a chief

‘ And not a comrade. Snekes, thirsi, buming saud

‘ The breve man weloomes‚ end the patient breast

‘ Finds happiness in labour. By its eost
