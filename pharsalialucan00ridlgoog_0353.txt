Then should he suffen and o night· os life
Thus by Pothinus was to Caeser given.
Now {rom the Cosian rock looked forth the Sun
Flooding the land of Egypt with a day
Worm from its earliest down, when from the wells

But drewn in close army, os though to meet
A soe opposing3 ready to receive

His cause forbidding hope, looked at the futes

He knew were hostile, with unfaltering gaze,

Now feam before the crime of hireling slaves,

And in mid paloee trembles at the blow ε

He whom nor Scythion nor Alaun had dared

To violate, nor the Moor who aimo the dart

Upon his viotim slein, to prove his skill. ⁶5⁰
'lhe Roman world but now did not suffice

To hold him, nor the realms from furthest Ind

To Tyrion Gades. Now, as puny boy,
