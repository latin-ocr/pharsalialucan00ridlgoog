Booxv ΤΗΕ MUTINY

The worst, his wish, and love the spoils of wer.
Nor secred he ought save onler at the hands
Of thot unconquered host. Art thou not ohamed
That strife should please thee only, now condemned 360
Even by thy minions? Sholl they chrink from blood,
They from the sword recoil? ond thou rush on
Heedless of guilt, through right ond through unright,
Nor leam thot men may lay their arms acide
Yet beor to live? This civil butchery
Escopes thy grosp. Stay thou thy crimes at length ;
Nor force thy will on those who will no more.
Upon a turfy mound unmoved he stood
And, since he fenred not, worthy to be secred ς
And thus while anger stined his soul began : ³1⁰
‘ Thou that with voice and hand didit roge but now
‘ Agoinst thine absent chief, behold me here;
‘ Plunge in this hmast, all ready lor the wound

‘ And bare, thy sword; and end the wer ond fiee.

‘ This mutiny devoid of during deed

‘ Betrays your cowanl souls, betrays the youth

‘ Who tires ol victorico which gild the arms

‘ Os an unconquered chief, ond yemns for llight.

‘ Lecve me to fate; with that l'll wuge the war

‘ You 1 cest forth. For every weapon left, oco

‘ Fortune shall find a mon, to wield it well.

⁶ Sholl Magnus in his ssight with such o lieet

⁴ Draw natione in his train3 and not to me

‘ My victorico bring legions? They shall rcap

‘ For iu mere close the prizes of the war

‘ Won by your toll, and ocatheleoc join the train
‘That leads my chariot to the sacred hill :

⁴ While you, despised in age oud battle worn,

‘ Gaze on our triumph from the civic crowd.

‘ Think you your dastmd flight shall give me pause? ³90
