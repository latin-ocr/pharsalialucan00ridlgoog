Boot 1v WAR IN THE ADRIATIC 107

Thus will the cunning huntcr dmw a line
0f tainled fealhers poisoning the air3
Or spiead the mesh, end munle in his grasp
The attaining jaws of the Molocsinn hound,
And leash ihe Spartan pnck3 noris the brake
Tnisled to any dog but such as tracks
The sceni with loweied nostrils, and refrains
From giving tongue the while ς content to mark ⁶00
By ehaking cord the covent of the prey.

Ere long they menned lhe rests in enger wish
To quit lhe island, when lhe latest glow
Still perled day from night„ But Magnus' troops,
Cilicien once, taught by their ancient aii,
In heudulent deceit hed lest lhe sec
To view ungunrded3 but nith chains unseen
Fnst to lllyiian shores, end hnnging loose,
They blocked the outlet in the waves benealh.
The leading rastis passed sasely, but the third, διο
Canghl by lhe rope, was drawn beneeth the rocks.
These, hollowed by the een, in ponderous mess
O'erhanging, seemed upon the point tc fal13
And trees mede dnrk the wave. Here ost the mnin
within lhe deep recens sweeps broken wiecks
And bodies of the drowned, till ebbing tides
Reium the spoil. 'Ihen from the cavemous nich
Is belched the ocean forth in such turmoil
Οἱ swirling billows, es excels the rege
0f that lamed whirlpool on Sicilian shores. 520

Hem, with Venetien settlers sor its lond,
Slood motionless the rust. Octavius* ships
Gatheied emund, while foemen on the land
Filled nll the shore. But well lhe captain knew,
Vulteius, how the senet hund was plnnned,
And hied in vain with swonl and cieel lo burst
