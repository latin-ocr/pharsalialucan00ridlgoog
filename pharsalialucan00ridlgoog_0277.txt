For prostrate, venquished in the civil wem
Is he who gave it,

Furling now his soils,
Magnus with oeos approached th' eccumed land,
When in their little boet the murderous crew
Drew nigh. and seigning from th' Egyptian court
Α mady welcome, blamed the double tides
Brolen by shallows, and their soenty beech
Unfit for fleets; end bade him to their cmft
leaving his lostier ship. Hod not the fates' ooo
Eternal end mmlterable lows
Called for their victim and decoeed his end

To Magnus, who bestowed the Pherian eroon,

ln truth were open, should not king and lieet

Withstood his bidding, end with etms outspmmi
Frenzied she cried: ‘And whither without me,
‘ Cruel, departest? Thou forbad'st me shaoe
‘ Thy risks 'lheeseliam dost again oommend
‘That 1 should part from thee? No happy ster
‘ Breehs on our sorrow. If from every land ooo
‘ 'lhou dost deber me, why didst turn eside
‘ ln ssight to Iesbos? 011 the weves alone
⁴ Am l thy fit oomponion ?' Thus in vein,
Ieaning upon the bulwork, doied with dread3
