Boou vl DYRRHACHIUM 159

'l'hen died the soldiers, for the streams they drunk
Held yet more poison than the air: the skin
Was dark and rigid, and the dery plague
Made hard their vitais, and with pitiless tooth
Gnawed at their wasted features, while their eyes 120
Started from out their sockets‚ aud the head
Drooped from sheer weariness. So the disease
Grew swifter in its strides till source was room,
''l'wixt lise and death, for sickness, and the pest
Slew as it struck its victhn, aad the dead
Thrust from the tents (such all their burial) lay
Blent with the living. Yet their camp was pitched
Hard by the breecy sea by which might come
All nations' homesta and the northern wind
Not seldom rolled the murky air away. iso
Their foe, not vexed with pestilentia] air
Nor stagnant waters, ample range enjoyed
Upon the spacious uplands: yet as though
In leaguer‚ famine seized them forits poey.
Scarce were the crops half grown when Caesar saw
How prone they seized upon the iood of beasts,
And stripped of leaves the bushes and the groves‚
And dragged from roots unknown the doubtful herb,
Which might be death: all things they ate that fire
May sosten, or teeth may bite, or arid throat iio
May swallow3 things that never heretofore
Were placed on tables—thus the host at large-
Yet was there plenty with the leaguered ioe.

When Magnus first was pleased to break his bonde,
No nightly dash he makes, by craft to seize
His sleeping foe unarmed: his soul had scorned
Such path obscure to iictory. 'lbvas his aim,
To lay the turrets low 3 to mark his track,
By ruin spread asan and with the sword
