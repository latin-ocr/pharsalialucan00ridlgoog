62 PHARSALIA Boot 111

‘With busy fingens all their needful task
‘Could searce accomplish and the threads of fate

‘Dropped from their weary hands. With me thy wife,

‘Th0u‚ Magnus, leddest happy triumphs home:
‘New wedlock brings new luck. Thy concubine,
‘Whose star brings all her mighty husbands ill,
‘ Cornelia, weds in thee a breathing tomb.¹
‘Through wars and oeeans let her cling to thee
‘So longas 1 may break thy nightly rest : ³0
‘No moment left thee for her love, but all

‘By night to me, by day to Caesar given.

‘Me not the oblivious banks of Lethe's stream
‘Have made forgetful; and the kings of death
‘Have suffered me to join thee ς in mid fight

‘I will be with thee, and my haunting ghost
‘Remind thee Coesar's daughter was thy spouae.
‘Thy swoml kills not our pledges3 civil war

‘Shall make thee wholly mine! She apale and fied.
But he, though heaven and hell thus bode defeat, 4ο
More bent on war, with mind assured of ill,

‘Why dread vain phantoms of a dreaming brein?
‘ Or nought of sense and feeling to the soul
‘Is lest by death; or death itaelf is nought.'
Now fiery Titan in declining path
Dipped to the vavas, his bright circumfemnce
So much diminished as a growing moon
Not yet full circled‚ or when past the full ;
When to the fleet a hospitable coast
Gave aceass, and the ropes in order laid, 50
The sailors struck the masta and rowed ashore.
Thus was the lieet set free and rapt from view
By favouring breezes. On Italian soil

¹ 1 take ¹ tepido busto 'as the dative ease; and aa referring te Pompeius,
doomed, like Oornalia's former husband, to defeat and death.
