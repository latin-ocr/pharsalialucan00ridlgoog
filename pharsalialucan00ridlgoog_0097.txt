PHARSALIA Βοοι 111

‘Not from our tressruy reward for guilt

‘Thy hosts shall revish: other towns are left, 150

‘And other nations3 seek thy gists from them;

‘Nor drsin Rome's peeoe for spoil: wer still is thine'
Aroused to anger then the victor speke:

‘Vein is thy hope to fall in noble death ;

‘Dost reokon Freedom sele with thee for girord?

‘With all thine honours, thou of Coessr's τῳ

‘Art little worthy: never shall thy blood

‘Defile his hund. 'Iime lowest things with high

‘ Consounds not yet so much thet, if thy voioe

‘Could save the lows‚ it were not better far rso

‘They fell by Caesar? Such his lofty words.
But os the Tribune yielded not, his rege

Rose yet the more, end st his soldiers' swords

One look he cest, lorgetting lor the time

What robe he wore; but soon Metellus heard

These words fmm Cotta· ‘When men bow to power
‘Freedom of speech is only Freedom's bone,¹

‘Whose shsde at least survives‚ is with free will
‘Thou dost whste'er is bidden thee. For us

‘Some pardon may be found: a host of ills 17⁰
‘Compelled submissim, end the shame is less
‘ That to have done which oould not be rehrsed.
‘Yield, then, this wealth, the seeds of direful war.
‘A nation's anger is by losses stiwerd,
‘When laws protect it; but the hungry slave
‘Brings danger to his moster, not himself?
At this Metellus yielded from the peth3

And os the getes rolled backward‚ echoed loud²
The rock Tarpeiae, and the temple's depths

¹ Thst ts, the liberty remelnlng to the people is destroyed by speehtng
freely to the tyrant.

¹ Quotsd by Dante end applied to the getes ot Purgatory. ‘Purg.,' ln,
129.
