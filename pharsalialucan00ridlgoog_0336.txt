crassa rw rerer

Wrrrn Caesar, following those who bore the head,
First trod the shore aecursed‚ with Egypt's fetes
His fortunes battled, whether Rome should pass
In crimson conquest o'er the guilty land,
Or Memphis' arms should rarish hom the world
Victor and vanquished: and the warning shade
Of Magnus saved his kinsman from the sword.

By that dread crime assured his standards borne
Before, he marched upon the Pharian town;
But when the people‚ jealous of their lawe, ιο
Murmured against the fasces, Coesar knew
Their minds were adverse, and that notior him
Was Magnus' murder wrought. And yet with hrow
Dissembling sear, intrepid‚ through the shrines
Of Egypt's gods he strode, and round the fane
Of ancient Isis ; bearing witness all
To Macedon's vigour in the days of old.
Yet did nor gold nor ornament restrain
His hasting steps, nor worship of the gods,
Nor city ramparts: but in greed of gain 20
He sought the cave dug out emid the tombs.¹

The madman offspring there of Philip lies,
The iamed Pellaean robber, Fortune's friend,

¹ The body oi Alexander was embalmed and the mummy placed in s
class case. The sarcophagus which enclosed them is stated ro be now in
the British haeum.
