Boon lx CATO 299

By aeaut division from Byzantium's hold

Chalcedon oyem-rich: and small the atrait 1130
'lhrongh which Propontis poure the Euxine wava.
'lhen marvelling at their ancient fame, he aeeka
Sigeum's aandy beach and Simoia' suenni,
Rhoeteum noble forits Grecian romb,
And all the heroea' chades, the thema of song.
Next by the town of Troy bumt down of old
Now but a memorabla name, he turns
His steps, and aearches for the mighty atonea
Relioa os Phoebus' wall. But bare with age
Forento of trees and mouldering trunka oppraased 114⁰
Aaaaracua’ palate, and with wearied roots
Poaseeaed the ancient temples οἰ the gods.
All Pergamus with denaed hrake was veiled
And even her stones were periahed. He beheld
Thy took, Hesione 3 the hiddeu grove,
Anchiaea' nuptial chamber; and the cave
Where aat the arbiter3 the apot from which
Was anatched the beauteoua youth 3 the mountain lawn
¹Whe1e mourned OEnone. Not a stone but told
The story ol the past. A little atroam 115⁰
Soarce trickling through the arid plain he paued,
Nor knew 'twas Xanthus: deep in grana he placed,
Cardena, hia footstep3 but the herdsman cried
‘ Thou tread'at the duat of Hector.' Sionea confused
Lay at his leet in sacred ahape no more:
‘ look on the altar of J ove,' thua apake the guida,
⁶ God of the household guardian ol the home.'
0 sacred taak of poeta, toil supreme,
Which reacuing all things from allotted fate
Dost give eternity to mortal meu! 116
Grudge not the glory, Cesar, of such fame.
