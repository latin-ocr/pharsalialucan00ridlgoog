PHARSALIA 1³00: ru

By piles ol hosting corpses rue the sides,
Though grappled, kept nsunder. Some, half deod,
Plunge in the ooenn, gulping down the brine
Enorimsoned with their blood ; some lingering still
Drnw their last struggling breoth omid the wreclr
0f broken nevies t weapons which have missed
Find yet their victims, and the falling stcel
Foils not in middle deep to deal the wound.
One vessel circled by Phoooean keels
Diwides her strengflr, und on the right and left ooo
On either side with equnl war contends3
On whose high poop while Tagus fighting gripped
The stern Phoooeon, pierced his buck and breost
Two fatal weopons; in the midst the steel
Met, end the blood, uncertain whence to flow,
stood still, onested, till with double course
Forth by o sudden gush it drove ench dart,
And sent the lise obrood through either wound.

Here fahed Telon also steered his ship:
No pilot's hand upon an angry sea oso
More deltly ruled o vessel. Well he knew,
Or by theson or crescent moon, how best
To set his oenvus fitted sor the breeze
The coming hours would bring. His rushing stem
Shettered a Romen vessel: but a dart
llurled at the moment quivered in his breust.
lle falls, and in the fall his dying hand
Diverts the prow. Then Gyareus, in oct
To climb the friendly deck, by jawelin piemed,
Still ns he hung, by the retaining steel uro
Fest to the side was nailed.

Twin brethren stand

l A huitful mother's pride: with different futes,
But ne'er distinguished till deoth's savage hond
