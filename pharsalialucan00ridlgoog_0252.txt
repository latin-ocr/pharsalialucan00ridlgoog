soor vn THE BA'I'PLE 223

0st on the conquerors and their impious arms
Or purple rain of blood, or mouldering flesh
Fell from the lotty heaven 3 or limbs of men ssu
From wamy talons dropped. Yet even so
The peoples passed not all into the maw
of ravening beast or fowl ; the inmost flesh
Scarce did they touch, nor limbs—thus lay the dead
Scorned by the spoiler; and the Roman host
By sun and length of days, and rain from heaven,
At length was mingled with Emathia's plain.
Ill-starred Thessalia! By what hateful crime
’ Didst thou offend that thus on thee alone
Was laid such carnage? By what length of years rouo
Shalt thou be cleansed from the curse ol war?
When shall the harvest of thy flelds mise
Free from their purple stain? And when the share
Cease to uptum the slaughtered hosts of Rome?
First shall the battle onset souud again,
Again shall flow upon thy lated earth
Α crimson torrent. Thus may be o'erthrown
Our sires' memorials; those erected last,
Or those which pierced by ancient roots have spread
Through broken stones their sacred urus abroad. solu
Thus shall the ploughman of Haemonia gase
On more abundant ashes, and the rahe
Pass o'er more frequent bones. Wert, Thracia, thou,
Our only battlefield‚ no sailor's hand

Upon thy shore should make his cable iastz
No spade should turn, the husbandmen should llee

Thy fields‚ the restingplace of ‘Roman dead ;
No lowing kirre should grase, nor shepherd dare
To leave his sseecy charge to browse at will

On fields made fertile by our mouldering dust3 102⁰
All bare and unexplorcd thy soil should lie,
