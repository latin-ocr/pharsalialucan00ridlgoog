Again to pardon. Caesor stood and saw
The dark blood welling forth end death et hond,

And thus in words of scorn: ‘And dost thou lie,
‘ Domitius, there? And did Pompeius name
‘ Thee his sueoessor, thee? Why leovest thou then
⁴ His standarde helpless l' But the parting lile
Still leintly throbbed within Domitius' brenel,
Thus finding utteranoe ι ‘Yet thou hest not won
‘ Thy heteful prim, for doubtful are the laten

‘ Waning no more, 1 eeek the silent shedes,
‘ Yet with this hope in death, thet thou subdued
‘To Magnus ond to me in grievous grrise

That it trainlixed to earth. Here hom the veins
Spouted the lise-blood, till the foeman's arms
Were cn'msoned. One his brother slew, nor dered
To spoil the conse, till severed fmm the neck
lle flung the head afar. Another dnshed
Full in his father's teeth the fatal swonl, 7³0
By murderous frenzy striving to disprove
His kinship with the slain. Yet for each death
We lind no separate dirge, nor weep lor rnen
