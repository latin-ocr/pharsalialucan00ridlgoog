Βοοι vl11 DEATH OF POMPEIUS 243

‘ King J uba faithless and the southenr realms,

‘Then seek we Pharos. Egypt on the west

‘ Girt by the trackless Syrtes forces back

‘ By sevenfold stream the ooean; rich in gleba

‘And gold and merchandise; and proud of Nile

‘ Aska for no rain frorn heaven. Now holds this boy

‘ Her sceptre, owed to thee; his guardian thou: olo

‘ And who shall sear this shadow of a name?

‘ Hope not from monarcha old, whose shame is fled,

‘ Or laws or troth or honour of the gods:

‘ New kings bring mildest sway.' ¹

His words prevailed

Upon his hearers. With what freedom speaks,
When states are trembling, patriot despair!
Pompeios' voice was quelled.

For Cyprus then

They shaped their course, whose altars more than all
The goddess loves who from tha Paphian vave

Spmng, mindful of her birth, if such be truth‚ ⁶2⁰
And gods have origin. Past the oraggy isle

Pompeius sailing‚ left at length astam

Its southern cape, and shnck across the main

With vinds transverse and tides ; nor reached the rnount
Grateful to sailors forits nightly gleam :

But to the bounds of Egypt hardly won

With battling canvas, where divided Nile

Pours through the shallows his Pelusian stream.2

Now was the soason when tha heavenly scale

¹ Thus rendered by Thomas May, ol tha Long Parliament:

‘Man used to sceptres ara asharned of nought:
‘Tha mildest govamamant a kingdoma finds

western.
