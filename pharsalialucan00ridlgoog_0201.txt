PHARSALIA 3001 v1

The shrine of Delos nor the Pythian oeves3
Nor vos he satisfied to leem the sound

Of J ove's bross oeuldmn, 'mid Dodons's oaks,
By her' pn‘maeval fruits the nurse ol men :

Nor sought he seges who by ssight cf birds,

Or walching with Assyrien cere the stars

And fires cf heaven, or by victims elain, διο
May know theletos tc come; nor any somne
Lavful though secret. For to him was known
'rhat which excites the hate of gods above 3
Magiciens' lore, the savcge creed cf Dis

And all the shodes; end scd with gloomy rites
Mysten'ous altars. For his frenzied ocul
Heaven knew too little. And the spot itself
Kindled his madness, for honi by there dwelt
The brood cf Haemon ¹ whom no storied vitch
0f fiction e'er transcended3 all their art

In things most strange and most incredible3
There were Thessalian molis with deedly herbs
Thick planted, sensible to magio chents,
Funereah secret: ond the land vos full

0f violence to the gods: the Queenly guest ²
From Colchis gethered here the fatal roots
Thet were notin her store: hence vein to heaven
Rise impious incantations all unheord3

For deef the ears divine: seve for one voice
Which penetrales the furthest depths of air oco
Conipelling e'en th' unwilling deities

Tc heerken to its accents. Not the cere

0f the revolving sky or star-ry pole

Can coll them fmm it ever. Once the sound

¹ Son ol Pelasgus. From him nas derived the ancient neme ol Tbessaly.
