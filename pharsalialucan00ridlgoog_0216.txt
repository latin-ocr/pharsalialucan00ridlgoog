Βοοι vl THE W ITCH OF THESSALIA 187

⁸ Which saw your eouquests, now shall hold alike
‘ Your burisJ-place-nor has the earth for you

‘A happier land than this?
His task perfomred‚

He stands in mournful guise, with silent look

Asking for death again ς yet could not die

Till mystic herb aud magic chant prevailed.

For nature's law, once used, had power no more

To slay the corpse and set the spirit free. aaa
With pleuteous wood she builds the funeral pyra

To which the dead man comes z then as the flames
Seized ou his form outstretched, the youth and witch
Together sought the camp ; and as the dawn

Now streaked the heavens, by the hag's command
The day was stayed till Sextus reached his tent,

And mist and darkness veiled his safe return. ..
