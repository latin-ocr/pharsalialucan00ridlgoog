‘This Pherian vasaah matching from mankind

‘ The happy morning which had shown the world
6 Α peace between us. But my prayera to heaven
‘ No favouring nnsver found; that arms laid down

‘ l might embrace thee, begging thee to grant

‘ Thine ancient love to Caeaar, and thy life.

‘ Thus for my laboura with a vortby prize

‘ Content, thine equal, bound in faithful peace,

‘ l might have brought thee to forgive the gods

6 For thy dietatem thou hadst gained for me

6 F rom Rome forgiveness.'

Thus he spake, but found
No comrade in his team ς nor did the host
Give credit to hia grief. Deep in their brenen
They hide their groens, and gaze with joyful front 1³2⁰
(0 famous Freedom Ξ) on the daed of blood:
And dare to laugh when mighty Caeaar vept.
