PREFACE ΤΟ THE FIRST EDITION xix

and Sullan massacres, however, have been to some extent
shortened, and the catalogue in Book 1. has been lightly
passed over. But the description of the serpents in Book IX.
has been rendered at nul length. The speeches especially
have been carefrdly studied, with a view of giving its full
weight to each expression. They form, as has been said, one

With regard to proper names, I have in some instances,

written Gaul or Gallia, and not France, though Marlowe
spoke of the Rubicon as

Dividing just
