Boon IX CATO

On seas Italian, Pilot of the deep,
Hast thou thy monument; and Libya too
Claims that her tranquil harbours pleaaed thy soul.
Then in the distance on the main arose
The shining canvas of a stranger fleet,
Or friend or foe they knew not. Yet they dicad oo
In every keel the presence of that chief
'lheir sear-compelling conqueror. But in truth
'lhat navy team and sorrow bore, and woes
To make e'en Ceto weep.
For when in vain
Cornelia prayed her stepson and the crew
To stay their ssight, lest haply from the shore
Beck to the sea might float the headless corse3
And when the fleme arising marked the place
Of that unhallowed rite, ‘Fortuna didst thou
‘ J udge me unfit‚' she cried, ‘to light the pyre το
‘ To caat myself upon the hero dead,
‘ The look to sever, and compote the limbs
‘ Tossed by the cruel billows of the deep,
‘ To shed a flood of team upon his wounds,
‘To fill my robe with ashes from his um,
‘ And scatter in the temples of the gods
‘ All thet 1 could, his dust? That pyre bestows
‘ No honour, haply hy some Phnrian hand
‘ Piled up in insuit to his mighty shade.
‘ Happy the Crassi iying on the waste no
⁴ Unbun'ed. To the greater shame os heaven
‘ Pompeius has such funeral. And shall this
‘ For ever be my lot? her husbands elain
‘ Cornelia ne'er enclose within the tomb,
‘ Nor shed the tear beside the urn that holds
· ‘ The ashes of the loved ? Yet for my grief ¹
‘ What boote or monument or ordered pomp ?· >
