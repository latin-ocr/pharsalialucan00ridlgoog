noox1v CAESAR IN SPAIN 97

‘ No bridge nor ford; but stem with brawny anns
‘ The foaming river? Rushing to the fray
They dare the torrent they had leared in ssight.
Their anns regained, they raee until the blood
Throbs in their veins anew, and their wet liinbs
Are warni again. At length the shadows fall
Short on the swerd, and day is at the height.
Then dash the horsemen on, and hold the foe
Twixt ssight and battle. ln the plain arose
Two roeliy heights: from each a lostier ridge 18⁰
Of hills ranged onwards‚ sheltering in their midst
A hollow vale, whose deep and winding paths
Were safe from warfare; which, when Caesar saw
That if Petreius held, the war must pass
To landa remote by savage tribes possessed:
‘Spoed on‚' he eries, ‘and meet their ssight in front;
‘ F ieroe be your frown >and battle in your glauce:
‘No cowsrsl's death be theirsz butas they flee
‘Plunge in their breasts the sword.' They seire the pass
And place their oamp. Short was the span between leo
Th' opposing sentinels; with eager eyes
Undimmed by spaoe‚ they ganed on brothers, sons,
Or friends and fathers3 and within their souls
They grasped the impious horror of the war.
Yet for a little while no voice was heard,
For lear restmined ; by waving blade alone
Or gesture, spolie they ; but their passion grew,
And brolie all discipline ς and soon they leep
The hostile rampart3 every hand ontstretehed ¹
Embraoes hand of heman, palm in palm ; 200

¹ Compare the passage in Tacitus. ‘nisis ii.. 45, in which tha historiari
daonbes how the troops oi Otho and Vitellius wapt ovar aaoh other aiter
the battle and deplored the miserias oi a oivil war. ‘Victi viatoresque in
lacrumas affusi, sortem civilium armorum miseni letitie detestantes!
