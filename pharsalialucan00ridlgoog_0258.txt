Boon vm DEATH OF POMPElUS 229

Some evil tidinge of the battle day :

Ney! it is he, thy husband in defeat:

Feer then no more, but weep3 nor waste the bour. oo
He leeps to lond; she marks the eruel doom

Wrought by the gods upon him: pule end wau

His weary features, by the hoary loclrs

Sheded3 the dust of travel on his gerb.

Dorlr on her soul a night of angrush fell ;

Her trembling limbs no longer bore her frome :

Sceroe throbbed her beart, end prone on earth she lay
Deoeived in hope of death. The boet mede fast,
Pompeius trending the lone waste of send
Drew neon whom when Cornelie's maidens saw, to
They steyed their weeping, yet with sighs subdued,
Reproeehed the fetes; and tried in vein to raise
Their mistress' form, till Magnus to his breast
Drew her with cherishing erms; ond et the touch
Of soothing hands the life-blood to her veins
Returued onoe more, and she could beer to look
Upon his features. He forbad despair,
Chiding her grief. ‘Notat the earliest blow
‘ By Fortune dealt, inheritress of farne
‘ Bequeothed by noble fathers, should thy strength so
‘ Thus fail and yield: renown shall yet be thine,

⁶ To last through egen not of laws decreed
‘Nor conquests won; a gentler path to thee

‘ As to thy sex, is given ; thy husband's woe.

⁶ Let thine affection stnrggle with the futes,

‘ And in his misery love thy lord the more.

‘ l bring thee greater glory, for thot gone

‘ Is all the pomp of lictors, gone the crowd

‘ Of faithful senators, end the bend of kings;

‘ Now first Pompeius for himself alone oo
‘'Tis thine to love. Curb this unbounded grief,
