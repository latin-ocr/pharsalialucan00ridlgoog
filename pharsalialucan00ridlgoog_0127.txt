PHARSALIA n0011v

One oalls by name his neighbour, one hie hosi,
Another with his oehoolmete taliis again
Of olden studies: he who in the oemp
Found not a oommde, was no son of Rome.
Wet are their arms with toan, ond eobo bieek in
Upon their hisoen each, unetained hy blood,
Dreedswhnt he might have done. Why beot thy bieest?
Why, madmen, weep? The guilt ie thine alone
To do or to absiein. Dost seer the men
Who takes his title to be feaned hom thee? 210
When Coesar's trumpets eound the cei] to mnis
Heed not the summons3 when thou seeet advonoe
His standands, halt„ The civil Fuiy thus
Shail sold her ningen end in o private robe
Caesar shall love his kinsman.
Holy Iove

Who swoy'st the universe, whooe firm embreoe
Binds the compected fabnc of the worid;
Come, gentle Conconi! these our times ¹ do now
For good or evil destiny oontml
The coming oenturies! Ah, cruel fate! 220
Now have the peopie lost their oloek for crime:
Their hope of panion. They have known their kin.
Woe for the respite given by the gods
Making mom blook the hideous guile to oome!

Now all was peeoefuh end in either oamp

Sweet oonverse held the soldiers3 on the grass

They pinoe the med, end pour the mingled oup;
Bright glows the turi upon the friendly fine ;

On mutual oouch with etorieo of their fights,

They while the sleepless houm in talk away ; 2³0

¹ ‘Soonln nostra· moy refer either to Luoan'e own timo or nothe moment

general meaning.
