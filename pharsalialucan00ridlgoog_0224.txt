Βωι w11 THE namn 195

‘All boundleas aeas, and land3 his staming troops
‘ Have snatched earth's crop half-grown, in vain attempt
‘ Their hunger to appaase; they prayed for death,
‘ Sought for the sword·thmst, and within our ranke
‘ Were fain to mix their life-blood with your own.
‘ Much of the war is done: the conscript youth
‘ Whose beart beate high, who burns to join the fray 120
‘ (Though men light hard in terror of defeat),
‘The abach of onset need no longer fear.
‘ Bravest isba who promptly meets the ill
‘ When fate commanda it and the moment comes,
‘Yet brooks delay, in prudenoe; and shall we,
‘ 0ur happy state enjoying, risk it all?
‘ Trust to the sword the fortunas of the world?
‘ Not victory, but battle, ye demand.
‘ Do thou, 0 Fortune, of the Roman state
‘ Who mad'st Pompeius guardian, from his hands 1³0
‘ Tale back the charge grown weightier, and thyself
‘ Commit its safety to the chance of war.
‘ Nor blame nor glory shall be mine today.
‘ Ἠιγ prayers unjustly, caesar, have prevailed:
‘ We fight! What wickedness, what woes on men,
‘ Destruction on what realms this dawn shall bring!
‘ Crimson with Roman blood yon stream shall run.
‘ Would that (without the ruin of our cause)
‘The first fell bolt hurled on this cumed day
‘ Might atrike me lileless! Victory to me 1⁴⁰
‘ Were not mone joyful, for this battle brings
‘ Α name of pity or a name of hate.
‘ 'lhe loser bears the burden oi defeatz
‘ 'lhe victor wins, but conquest is a crime?
Thus to the soldiers, buming for the fray,
He yields, forbidding, and throws down the reios.

So may a sailor give the winds control
