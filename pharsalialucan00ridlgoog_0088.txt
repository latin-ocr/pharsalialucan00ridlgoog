Boon 11 THE FLIGHT OF POMPEIUS 57

Alreedy shone the Virgin in the sky
Leading the Soorpion in her course, whose claws
Foreiell the rising Sun, when noiseless all
They onst the vessels loose; no song was hennl
To greet the enchon wrenched from stubborn sand3
No captain's order, when the losty mast 790
Wns raised, or ynrds were bent3 n silent orew
Drew down the sniis which hung upon the ropes,
Nor shook the mighty nobles, lest the wind
Should sound upon them. But the chief, in prayer,
'rhus spake to Fortune: ‘Thon whose high deense
‘Has madeus exiles from Italia's shores,
‘Grani us nt least to leave them? Yet the fans
Henily pennitted, for a murmur vost
Come from the ooean, as the oounfless heels
Furrowed the waters, and with oenseless splnsh ooo
The pnrted billows rose again end fell.
Then were the gates thrown wide ; for with the fetes
'Ihe city turned to Caesar: and the foe,
Seizing the town, rushed onwani by the pier
That circled in the herbour3 then they knew
With shnme and sorrow that the {leet was gone
And held the open: and Pompeius* ssight
Gave a poor triumph.

Yet was nnrrower sor

The ehennel which gave eooess ho the sea

Thon that Euboeon strait¹ whose wateis lave διο
'lhe shore by Chalcis. Here two ships stuok fast
Alone, of all the fleet3 the fatal hook

Grnppled their deoks ond drew thern to the lond,

And the first bloodshed of the civil war
Here lest a blnsh upon the ocean wave.

¹ n seems that the Euripus was bridged over. (Mr. Haskins’ note.)
