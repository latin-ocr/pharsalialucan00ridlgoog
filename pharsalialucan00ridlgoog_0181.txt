‘'l'o be his hosfage. lf thou place nre there,
³ The sponse of Magnus, shall nol all the world
⁶ W ell know the secret Mitylene holds?
‘ This my last prayer: if all is lost but ssight,

‘Turn not thy keel, ill·fated one: forthere,
‘There will lhey seek thee? Thus she spoke dis· 910
traught‚
Leaped from the conch and rushed upon her fafe;
No stop nor stay: she clung not to his neck
Nor threw her arms about him 3 both forego
The last carens, the last fond pledge of love,
And grief rushed in unchecked upon their souls;
Stil] gazing as they part no final words
Could either utter, and the sweet Farewell
Remained unspoken. This the saddest day
Of all their lives: for other noes chat came
More gently struck on hearne innred to grief. 920
Borne fn lhe shore with failing limbs she fell
And grasped the sande embnwing, till at last
ller maidens placed her seneeless in the ship.

Not in such grief she lest her country's shores·
When Caesar's host drew near; for now she leaves,
Though faithful to her lord‚ his side in ssight
And flees her sponse. All that next night she waked3
Then first what means a widowed couch slre knew,

Its cold, its solitudo. When elumber found

ller eyelids‚ and forgetfulness her soul, nnn
Sccking wilh ontstretehed arms the form beloved,

She grnsps but air. 'l'hough wssed by resllese lore,
She leaves a place beside her ns for him

Returning. Yet she feared Pompeius lost

To her for ever. Nay! such happy lot

The gods prepared nol; for· the honr drew near

Which gave her Magnus to her anns again.
