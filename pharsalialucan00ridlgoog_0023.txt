xiv PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION

scafightinBook 111. Butaspiritedand patrioticspostrophe,
or the vigorous eloquenoe oi Coto or Caesar, or a powerful
snd drametic description combine to give the poem force,
andtomaintain in power and interest; and imparttoita
fascination under the glsmour of which its fsults are
iorgotten.

Very contrary opinions have been. expressed as to the
merits of the poem as a whole. Niebuhr (⁶ Lectures on the
History of Rome‚' iii. 193) says, ‘Lucan belongs to the time
oi Nero, and his poetry proceeded imm the school of Seneca„
His example shows us how much more intolersble its tendency
is in poetry thsn in prose. Bemardin de St Piens and
Chatesubrisnd are the offspring οἲ a similar school. . . . It
would be more besrable ii it did not venture upon anything
but sentimental moralising, as in the case of the formem
but Chatesubriend isa perfect pendant to the bad poet Lucan.
This is not yet generally recognised, indeed, but the opinion
which now prevails in regard tobis merits cannot continue.'

Here we have an uniair and incompleta criticism‚ and an
unfulfilled prophecy. In spite of what Niebuhr says, the
‘ Pharsalia* has qualities which must always continue to excite
the interest of mankind.

To turn to the opposite extreme, Shelley, in aletter dated
September 1815, says, ‘ Ι have also read the four iirst books
oi Lucsn's “ Pharsalia,” a poem, ss it appears to me, oi
wonderful genius and transcending Virgil' ¹

I should have supposed that no admirer of Lucan would
cere to rest his reputation on Books 11., 111., or 1v., and it
would be interesting to know whether Shelley retained the
opinion he expressed in his letter.

Lord Maesulay (Trevelyan's ‘Life and letters* i. 462)
calls Lucan an excellent writer. 1 have already mentioned
his opinion of the speech of Cato in Book IX. He also selected
