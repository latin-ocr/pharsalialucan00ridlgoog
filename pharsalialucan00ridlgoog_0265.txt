Rhodos, and steering for the middle deep
Escaped the vindings of Telmessus' bay3
Till mse Pamphylian coasts before the burk,
And first the fallen chieftain dated to find
In small Phaselis shelter; for therein

Scarce was the husbandmen, and empty homas

Forbad to fear. Next Taurus' heights he saw

Received their fleet, where fair Selinus' stream
In spacious bay gives refuge from the main;
And to the gethered chiefs in mournful words

6 Our place of maeting‚ and no gathered host
6 Surrounds us, yet upon our changed estate
6 Ι seek your counsel. Rouse ye as of yore
6 With hearts of courage! Magnus on the field
6 Not all is perished, nor do fatas forbid
6 But that 1 rise afresh with living hope
6 Of future victories‚ and spum defeat.
6 From Libyan ruins did not Marius rise διο
6 Again reoorded Consul ou the page
6 Full of his honours? shall a lighter blow
‘ Keep Magnus down, whose thousand chiefs and ships
‘ Still plough the billows; by defeat his strength
6 Not vhelmed but scattered? And the fame alone
