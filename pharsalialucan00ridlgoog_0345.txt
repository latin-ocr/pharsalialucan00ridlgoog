PHARSAIJA aomar

⁶ Nor lists his vave before the Dog star bums;
⁶ Nor seeks again his banks, until the sun

⁶ Iu equal balanoe measures night and day.

⁶ Nor are the laws that govern other streams

⁶ Obeyed by Nile. For in the wintry year

⁶ Were he in flood, when distant far the sun,

⁶ His waters lacked their offioe; buthe leaves

⁶ His channel when the summer is at height,

⁶ Tempering the torrid heat of Egypt's clime.

⁶ Such is the task of Nile 3 thus in the world 280
‘He finds his purpose, lest exoeeding heat

⁶ Consume the lands: and rising thus to meet
⁶ Enkindled lion, to Syene's prayers
⁶ By Cancer bumt gives ear3 nor curbs his wave
⁶ Till the slant sun and Meroe's lengthening shadea
⁶ Proclaim the autumn. Who shall give the oause?
⁶ 'l'was Parent Nature's sels which gave command
⁶ Thus for the needs of earth should flow the Nile.
⁶ Vain too the fable that the westem winds ¹
⁶ Control his current, in continuous course 2⁹0
⁶ At stated reasons governing the air3
⁶ Or hurrying from Oooident to South
⁶ Clouds without number which in misty folds
⁶ Press on the waters; or by constant blast,
⁶ F oroing his current back whose several mouths
⁶ Burst on the sea ;—so‚ soreed by sess and wind,
⁶ Men say, his billows pour upon the land.
⁶ Some speak of hollow oaverns, breathing holes
⁶ Deep in the earth, within whose mighty jaws
⁶ Waters in noiseless current underneath θοι
⁶ From northern cold to southern elimes are drawn ς

4 And when hot Meroe ponta beneath the sun,

¹ So. too. Herodotus. Book 11.. w, who attributes this theory ιο Greeks
who wish to get a reputation tor oleverness.
