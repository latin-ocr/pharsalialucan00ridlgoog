Conseious of guilty prayers‚ and of the hope 21⁰
To do to death their brothers end their sires,

One solaoe: that they found in heerls amared

With honore, and in earth end air distraught,

The bolts of Jupiter, predicting 111;

Or else the sky discordant o'er the space 2³0
0f heaven, from pole to pole ; or else perchsnoe
