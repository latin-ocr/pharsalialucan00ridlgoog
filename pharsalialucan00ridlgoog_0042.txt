ΒοοιΙ THE CROSSING OF THE RUBICON 11

‘ No further dere? But Caeser's hair was stiff
With horror as he gained, end ghestly dread
Restrained his footsteps on the further bank.
Then speke he, ‘ Thunderer‚ who from the rock

‘Tarpeien seest the well of mighty Rome ς
‘ Gods of my rece who wetehed o'er Troy os old ς

‘ Thou Jove of Albe's height, end Veste] fines,
⁶ And rites os Romulus erst rapt to heaven,
‘ And God·like Rome; be friendly to my quest. 230
‘ Not with offenoe or hostile arms 1 oome‚
‘ Thy Caesnr, oonqueror by land end see,
⁶ Thy soldier here end wheresoe'er thou wilt:
‘ No other's3 his, his only be the guilt ,
‘ Whose sets make me thy foe? He gives the word
And bids his stendenls eross the swollen stream.
So in the westes os Afric's buming elime
The lion crouches es his foer drew noer,
Feeding his wreth the while, his loshing teil
vaokes his fury3 stiff upon his neck 240
Bristles his mene: deep from his geping jaws
Resounds the muttered growl, end should a lance
Or jevelin reech him from the hunter's ring,
Seorning the puny sereteh he bounds afield.
From modest fountnin blood-red Rubicon
ln summer's heet flows ους his pigmy tide
Creeps through the velleys end with slender merge
Divides the Italian pensant from the Gaul.
Then winter geve him strength, end fraught with rain
The third dey's crescent moon; while Eestern winds 250
Thewed from the Alpine slopes the yielding snow.
'l'he cavalry first form across the stream
To break the torrent's force; the rest with ease
Beneeth their shelter gain the further bank.
When Caeser crossed and trod beneeth his feet
