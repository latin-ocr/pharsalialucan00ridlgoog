PHARSALIA noun<

The fable) by that god, whose sounding shell ¹
All sens end shores re·echo; end by her, 4ιο
Pollae, who springing from her sether's head
First lit on Libye, nearest land to heaven,

(As by ite heet ie proved) ς here on the brink
She stood, reflected in the placid weve

And called herself Tritonis. Lethe’s flood
Flows silent neor, in fable from a source

Infernal sprung, oblivion in hie stream

Here, hoo, that gerden of the Hesperids,

Its boughs all golden, where of old hie watch
The sleepless dmgon held. Shnme be on him 400
Who cells upon the poet for the proof

Of thet which in the ancient deys befell;

But here were golden groves by yellow growth
Weighed down in richness, here e mniden band
Were guardiam end a serpent, on whose eyes
Sleep never fell, was coiled eround the trees,
Whoee branchos bowed beneeth their ruddy lond.
But great Alcides stripped the goodly bonghs

0f all their richoo, lest them poor end light,

And bore the shining fruit to Argoo' king. 400
Driven on the Libyen reelms, more fruitful here,

Pompeius² eteyed the ficet, nor further dated

To Garamanticn wevee. But Cato'e soul

leoped in his bremt, impetierit of delny,

Το peso the Syrtes by a landward merch,

And tmeting to their ononis, 'geinet tribes unknown
To lead his legions. And the etorm which closed

The mein to nevies gave them hope of rein3

Nor hiring frosts they secred, in Libyan clime;

Nor sune too soonching in the falling year. 440
