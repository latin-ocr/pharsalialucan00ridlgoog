Βοοι vl vlcr0RY OF POMPEIUS 165

ln brimming flood, and foaming at his 1101111110,

Making whole districto quake3 and should the bank
Fail 'neoth 1110 awollen wetere, 011 hio stream

Breoks forth in ewirling eddies over fields 300
Νο1 his 110101ος 001110 lenda 010 lost, the rest

Gain imm hie bounty.

Hardly imm his tower
Hod Caesar seen the lire or known the fight:
And coming found the rampart overthrow,
The duat no longer stix-red, the ruins oold
Aa from 0 battle done. The peace that reigned
There and on Magnus' side, 00 though men slept,
Their victory won, aroused his angry 00111.
Quick he preparas, οο 11101110 end their joy
00101000 01 olaughter or defeat, 10 111011 330
With threatening oolumns on Torquatus' post.
But awiit 00 001101, by hia trembling 111001
Warned ol Ciroeian tempeot, furls his soils,
So swist Torquatus saw, and prompt to wage
The war more closely, he withdrew his men
Within a norrower wall.

Now past the trench

Were Caesar's oompanies, when from the 111110
Pompeius hurled his 11001 upon their ranks
Shut in, and hempered. Not 00 much o'erwhelmed
Aa Caeonr's soldiero io the hind who dwells 300
011 Etna's slopeo, when blowo the southern wind,
And all the mountain pours 110 0011Ῑά10110 forth
Upon the 101ος and huge Enceladus ¹
Writhing 1101100111 his load spouto o'er the plains
A blazing torrent. Blinded by the (11101,
Encircled‚ vanquiahed‚ ere the light, they 11οἀ
111 cloud oi terror on their reerwanl foe,

¹ This grant, like Typhon, war buried under 1100111 Ε1110
