She whirled throughout the 00νο, her looks ereot 000
With homor, ond the flllets 01 the god

Dnshed to the ground3 her steps unguided turned

To this side and to thut; the tripods fell

O'erturned3 within her seethed the mighty lire

01 ungiy Phoebus; nor with whip alone

He urged her 00000010, but with ourb restrnined3

Nor was it given her by the god to 000010

All thot she knew ; for into 000 00010000001

All time was gethemd, ond her panting chest

Groaned 'neoth the centuries. In onier long 000
All things loy bore: the future yet unveiled

Struggled for light; 00010 fate required 0 0010ος

Creation's death, the number 01 the sands,

All these she knew. Thus on 0 former day

Disdaining that her henzy should be slave

To other natione, from the houndless threads

Chose out with pride 01 hund theletos 01 Rome.
