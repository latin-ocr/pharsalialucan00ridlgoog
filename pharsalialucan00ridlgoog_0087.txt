56 PHARSALIA noos 11 '

Piled in the greedy main gigantic rocks:
Mountains of earth down to the sandy depths
Were swallowed by the vortex of the ερας
Just as if Eryx and its losty iop
Were ossi into the deep, yet not a speck
Should mark the watery plain; or Gaurus huge
Splii from his summit to his base, were plunged
ln iathomless Avernus' stagnant pool.
The billows thus unsiemmed 'twas Caesar's will
To hew the stately soraets and with trees 7⁶0
Enchained to form a rampart. 'Ihus of old
(lf fame be true) the boastful Persian king
Prepared a way across the rapid strait
'l'wixt Sestos and Abydos, and made one
The European and the Trojan shores;
And marched upon the waiam, wind and siorm
Counting as nought, bui trusting his emprise
To one frail bridge, so that his ships might pass
Through middle Athos. Thus a mighty mole
Os fallen foresta grew upon the naves, 770
Free until then, and lofty turreis rose,
And land usurped the entrance io the main.

This when Pompeius saw, with anxiam care
His soul was filled; yet hoping to regain
The exit lost, and win a wider world
Wherein io wage the war, on chosen ships
He hoists the saih; these, driven by the wind
Which filled the bellying sails, noi once nor twice
Soatiered the beams asunder; and ai night
Not seldom engines, worked by sialwart arms, rao
Flung flaming torches forth. But when the time
For secret ssight was oome, no sailor shout
Rang on the shore, no trumpei marked the hour,
No olarion oalled the armament io sea.
