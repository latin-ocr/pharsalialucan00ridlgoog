Held to their pledged obedience, end dered
To follow right, not fate; but first of nll ³5⁰
With olive boughe of truoe before them borne
The chiestuin they approach, with penoeful words
In hope to alter his unbending will
And tame his fury. ‘Search the ancient books
‘ Which chrouiole the deeds of Latiam fame3

‘ Massilio'e prowees on the side of Rome.¹
‘ And now, iftriumphe in en unknown world

‘ Of civil discord, witha Roman foe
6 'Ihou arm'st for battle, tears we give thee then
‘ And hold aloof : no stranger hund may touch
6 Celeetial wounds. Should ull Olympus* hosts
‘ Have rushed to war, or should the gient brood
‘ Aeseult the stare, yet men would not preeunte
‘ Or by their prayers or arms to help the gods:
6 And, ignorant of the fortunee of the sky,
‘ Taught by the thunderbolts alone, would know
‘ That Jupiter supreme still held the throne. 37⁰

‘ 'l'lmt civil wars reluctant swords require.
‘ But grant that strangers shun thy doetiniee
6 And only Romans light-shall not the son
‘ Shrink ere he strike his father? on both sides
‘ Brothern forbid the weapon to be hurled?
6 The world's end eomes when other hunde are armed
