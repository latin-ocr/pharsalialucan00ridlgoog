She uttem, scarce articulate: the bey
Of wolves‚ and berkinges of dege, were mixed
With that fell chant3 the screech of nightly owl

6 Hating thy mother ond the skies above,
‘ My patron goddess, last and lowest form¹ 8³0

6 Hold silent converse; warder of the gete

6 Who castest human offo] to the dog:

6 Ye sisters who shall spin the threeds again ς ²

6 And thou, 0 boatman of the huming wave,

6 Now wearied of the shodee from hell to me

6 Retuming‚ hear me if with voioe 1 my

6 Abhorred‚ polluted ; if the flesh of man

6 Hath ne'er been absent from my pmffered song,
6 Flesh washed with braine still quivering; if the child 840
6 Whose severed headl pleoed upon the dish

6 But sor this hand had lived-a listening ear

6 bend to my supplication! From the caves

6 Hid in the innemnoet mcess of hell
