PHARSALIA n0011

Her crew and captain leop into the sea,

Eooh making shipwreck for himself. ''l'was thus oso
They passed the city gotes ond flod to wer.
No agad parent now could stay his son;
Nor wife her sponse, nor did they pray the gods
To grant the safety of their fatherlond.
None linger on the threshold for a look
Of their loved city, though perohanoe the last.
Ye gods, who lovish prioeless gifts on men,
Nor core to guard them given! thus was Rome
Teeming with conquered natione, whose vest walls
Hod compessed all mankind, by ooward hands 570
To coming Caesar left an easy pney.
The Romen soldier, when in foreign londs
Pressed by the enemy, in nenow trench
And hurried mound finds guard enough to mole
His tented sleep secure: thou Rome alone
Upon the rumour of advencing war
Art left o desert, ond thy battlements
Not trusted for a night. Yet for their fear
This one excuse was left; Pompeius ded.
Nor found they room for hope; for nature gave oso
Unerring portento of worse ills to come.
Theongrygodsfilledeorthondoirandsea
With frequent prodigies; in derkest nights
Stronge constellations sparkled through the gloom :
The pole was ull ofire, ond torches flew
Across the depths of heaven; with horrid hair
A blozing comet stretohed from eost to west
And threatened change to kingdoms. From the blue
Pale lightning floshed, and in the murky air
'lhe lire took divers shepes3 o lnnoe afar 590
Would seem to quiver or o misty torch3
Α noiseless thunderbolt from cloudless sky
