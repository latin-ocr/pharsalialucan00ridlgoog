Boot VIII DEATH OF POMPEIUS 253

With prosperous Pompeius to the end.
'roas not for him iu evil days some ray
Of light to hope for. Shatterod from the height 820
Os power in one short moment to his death!
Yeors of unbroken victor-ies balonoed down
By one day's oarnnge! In his happy time
Hoeven did not haross him, nor did she spere
In misery. Long Fortune held the hand
'l'hat dsshed him down. Now beaten by the onds,
Torn upon rocks, the sport oi ooeon's wsves
Poured through its wounds, his heodless mroose lies,
Save by the looemted trunk unknown.
Yet ere the victor touched the Phorion sends 8³0
Some soonty rites to Magnus Fortune gave,
lest he should want all buriul. Pale with sear
Come Cordus, hosting from his hiding plaoe; Ι
Quaestor, he joined Pompeius on thy shore,
Idalion Cyprus, bringing in his trsin
Α cloud of evils. Through the dmkening shndes
Love for the deod compelled his trembliug steps,
Hord by the margin of the deep to search
And drag to land his master. Through the clouds
The moon shoue ssdly, ond her rays were dim ; 840
But by its hue upon the hosry moin
He knew the body. In a fast embraoe
He holds it, wrmtling with the greedy soe,
And destly watohiug for a refluent nave
Gains help to bring his burden to the lond.

'Ihen clinging to the loved remeius, the wounds

Woshed with his tems, thus to the gods he speaks,

And misty etms obscure: ‘Here Fortune, lies
‘ Pompeius, thine: no costly iuoense rare
‘Orpompoffuneralhedorestossk3 ⁸5⁰
‘ Nor that the smoke rise besvenward from his pyre
